    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <section>
      <p>This report presents a brief gate-set tomography (GST) analysis of a dataset called $(datasetLabel)s.   It is intended for folks who are already familiar with GST output tables and plots.  If this isn't you, you should have set <code>brief=False</code> when you generated this report.</p>

      <h1>Goodness-of-model Analysis</h1>
      <p>Table <a href="#progressTable" class="table"></a> shows how well GST was able to fit you data through its iterations, and <a href="#bestEstimateColorBoxPlot" class="figure"></a> displays the more detailed goodness-of-fit contributions from each individual gate sequence.</p>

    <figure class='tbl' id="progressTable">
      <figcaption><strong>Comparison between the computed and expected maximum $\log(\mathcal{L})$ for different values of $L$</strong>.  $N_S$ and $N_p$ are the number of gate strings and parameters, respectively.  The quantity $2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ measures the goodness of fit of the GST model (small is better) and is expected to lie within $[k-\sqrt{2k},k+\sqrt{2k}]$ where $k = N_s-N_p$. $N_\sigma = (2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})-k)/\sqrt{2k}$ is the number of standard deviations from the mean (a $p$-value can be straightforwardly derived from $N_\sigma$).  The rating from 1 to 5 stars gives a very crude indication of goodness of fit as explained in the text.</figcaption>

      <figcaption><strong>$2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ contributions for every individual experiment in the dataset</strong>.   Each pixel represents a single experiment (gate sequence), and its color indicates whether GST was able to fit the corresponding frequency well.  Shades of white/gray are typical. Red squares represent statistically significant evidence for model violation (non-Markovianity), and should appear with probability at most %(linlg_pcntle)s%% if the data really are Markovian. Square blocks of pixels correspond to base sequences (arranged vertically by germ and horizontally by length); each pixel within a block corresponds to a specific choice of pre- and post-fiducial sequences.  See text for further details.</figcaption>

      <h1>Gateset Estimates</h1>
      <p>Below is a collection of GST's primary result tables, ordered in what we think is a natural way.  These tables all pertain to the best-estimate gateset, that is, the one corresponding to the final iteration of the GST algorithm.  Table <a href="#bestGatesetGaugeParamsTable" class="table"></a> lists the relevant parameters used during the gauge optimization step which resulted in the estimates that follow.</p>

    <figure class='tbl' id="bestGatesetErrGenTable">
      <figcaption><strong>The GST estimate of the logic gate operation generators</strong>. A heat map of the <q>Error Generator</q> for each gate, which is the Lindbladian $\mathbb{L}$ that describes <em>how</em> the gate is failing to match the target.  This error generator is defined by the equation %(errorgenformula)s. When all elements of these matrices is zero, the estimated gates match the target gates (Table <a href="#targetGatesetTable" class="table"></a>).  Note that the range of the color scale is variable, being determined by the data.  In the third column, each generator is projected onto each of the <q>Hamiltonian generators</q> given by the action of commutation with each Pauli-product basis element.  In the forth column, each generator is projected onto each of the <q>Stochastic generators</q> given by the action of conjugation with each Pauli-product basis element.  Columns and rows correspond to Pauli operators on the first and second (if present) qubit.</figcaption>

In the third column, magnitudes of <em>negative</em> values are plotted using \textcolor{red}{red} bars. Unitary gates have a spectrum $(1,0,0\ldots)$, just like pure quantum states.  Negative eigenvalues are non-physical, and may represent either statistical fluctuations or violations of the CPTP model used by GST.</figcaption>

Each gate is represented as a $d^2\times d^2$ <em>superoperator</em> that acts by matrix multiplication on vectors in $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$.  Matrices are displayed using a heat map that ranges between 1.0 (red) and -1.0 (blue).  Note that it is impossible to discern even order-1%% deviations from the ideal using this color scale, and one should rely on other analysis for more a precise comparison.</figcaption>
