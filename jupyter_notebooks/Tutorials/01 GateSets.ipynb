    "# Gate Sets Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to create and use `GateSet` objects.  `GateSet` objects are fundamental to pyGSTi, as each represents a set of quantum gates along with state preparation and measurement (i.e. POVM effect) operations.  In pyGSTi, a \"state space\" refers to a Hilbert space of *pure* quantum states (often thought of as length-$d$ vectors, where $d=2^N$ for $N$ qubits). A \"density matrix space\" refers to a Hilbert space of density matrices, which while often thought of as $d \\times d$ matrices can also be represented by length $d^2$ vectors.  Mathematically, these vectors live in Hilbert-Schmidt space, the space of linear operators on the original $d\\times d$ density matrix space.  pyGSTi uses this Hilbert-Schmidt vector-representation for density matrices and POVM effects, since this allows quantum gates to be represented by $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrices which act on Hilbert-Schmidt vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis used for Hilbert-Schmidt space can be any set of $d\\times d$ matrices which span the density matrix space.  pyGSTi constains support for three basis sets:\n",
    "- the matrix unit, or \"standard\" basis, consisting of the matrices with a single unit (1.0) element and otherwise zero.  This basis is selected by passing `\"std\"` to appropriate function arguments.\n",
    "- the Pauli-product basis, consisting of tensor products of the four Pauli matrices {I, X, Y, Z} normalized so that $Tr(B_i B_j) = \\delta_{ij}$.  All of these matrices are Hermitian, so that Hilbert-Schmidt vectors and matrices are real when this basis is used. This basis can only be used when the $d = 4^i$ for integer $i$, and is selected using the string `\"pp\"`.\n",
    "- the Gell-Mann basis, consisting of the normalized Gell-Mann matrices (see Wikipedia if you don't know what these are).  Similar to the Pauli-product case, these matrices are also Hermitian, so that Hilbert-Schmidt vectors and matrices are real when this basis is used.  Unlike the Pauli-product case, since Gell-Mann matrices are well defined in any dimension, the Gell-Mann basis is *not* restricted to cases when $d=4^i$.  This basis is selected using the string `\"gm\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`GateSet` objects have the look and feel of Python dictionaries which hold $d^2\\times d^2$ gate matrices and length-$d^2$ state preparation and POVM effect vectors (collectively referred to as \"SPAM\" vectors). "

    "*  By creating an empty `GateSet` and setting its elements directly, possibly with the help of `pygsti.construction`'s `build_gate` and `build_vector` functions.\n",

    "### Creating a `GateSet` from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Gates and SPAM vectors can be assigned to a `GateSet` object as to an ordinary python dictionary.  Internally a `GateSet` holds these quantities as `Gate`- and `SPAMVec`-derived objects, but you may assign lists, Numpy arrays, or other types of Python iterables to a `GateSet` key and a conversion will be performed automatically.  To keep gates, state preparations, and POVM effects separate, the `GateSet` object looks at the beginning of the dictionary key being assigned: keys beginning with `rho`, `E`, and `G` are categorized as state preparations, POVM effects, and gates, respectively.  To avoid ambiguity, each key *must* begin with one of these three prefixes with the exception of `identity` which we will mention later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To separately access the state preparations, POVM effects, and gates contained in a `GateSet` use the `preps`, `effects`, and `gates` members respectively.  Each one provides dictionary-like access to the underlying objects.  For example, `myGateset.gates['Gx']` accesses the same underlying `Gate` object as `myGateset['Gx']`, and similarly for `myGateset.preps['rho0']` and `myGateset['rho0']`.  The values of gates and SPAM vectors can be read and written in this way. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to SPAM vectors and gate matrices, a `GateSet` holds a mapping between (state preparation, POVM effect) pairs and strings called \"SPAM labels\".  Each SPAM label identifies an experimental outcome, meaning \"I prepared state A and then measured outcome X\".  Experimental data is tabulated according to SPAM label, that is, each experimental count is assigned a particular SPAM label (this is explained further in the Dataset tutorial).  The map between (state preparation, POVM effect) pairs and \"SPAM labels\" is a dictionary called `spamdefs` whose keys are the SPAM labels and whose values are 2-tuples containing a state preparation label and POVM effect label.  The special POVM effect label \"remainder\" can be used to mean the identity minus all of the other POVM effects.  This \"remainder\" POVM effect is not properly contained within the `GateSet` (it is not parameterized during optimizations), but should rather be thought of as a quantity that can straightforwardly be *computed* from `GateSet` quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the \"remainder\" label is used, the `GateSet` must then know what the identity vector is, and so one must set the special `'identity'` key of the `GateSet` to the identity vector in whatever basis is being used for the SPAM vectors and gate matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Aside: Usually there is only a single state preparation, in which case the SPAM labels correspond directly with the POVM effects typically thought of as experimental outcomes.  However, if there *are* multiple state preparations, it is important that we treat the experiment counts for \"preparing state A and measuring outcome X\" and \"preparing state B and measuring outcome X\" differently.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly a **basis** may be specified (currenlty by giving a *name* and *dimension*) which allows one to conveniently track how the gate matrices in a `GateSet` should be interpreted in post processing.  In the case of a single qubit, the basis of Pauli matrices plus the identity is the natural basis.  PyGSTi contains support for bases consisting of the tensor product of Pauli matrices (or just the Pauli matrices in the case of 1 qubit), labelled `\"pp\"`, as well as the Gell-Mann matrices, labelled `\"gm\"`.  In cases when there are an integral number of qubits, and the dimension equals $2^N$, the `\"pp\"` basis is usually preferred since it is more intuitive.  In other cases, where the Hilbert space includes non-qubit (e.g. environmental) degrees of freedom, the Gell-Mann basis may be useful since it can be used in any dimension.  Note that both the Gell-Mann and Pauli-Product bases reduce to the usual Pauli matrices plus identity in when the dimension equals 2 (1 qubit).  Also note that tracking the basis doesn't affect the main GST optimization; only some post-processing tasks (e.g. tables in the reports) depend on the basis associated with a `GateSet`. "

    "### Creating a `GateSet` from scratch using `build_gate` and `build_vector`\n",
    "The `build_gate` and `build_vector` functions take a human-readable string representation of a gate or SPAM vector, and return a `Gate` or `SPAMVector` object that gets stored in the dictionary-like `GateSet` object.  To use these functions, you must specify what state space you're working with.  This is done via two quantities:\n",
    "1. **State space dimensions**: a list of integers specifying the dimension of each *block* in a direct-sum decomposition of the total state space.  For example, `[2]` means just a 2-dimensional Hilbert space, and `[2,2]` means the direct sum of two 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\n",
    "2. **State space labels**: a list of tuples of (string) labels.  Each tuple describes how to label the corresponding term of the direct-sum decomposition of the state space.  Thus, the length of the state-space-labels list must be equal to the length of the state-space-dimensions list.  The elements of a tuple must be strings that start with either \"Q\" or \"L\", and are followed by any letters or numbers of your choosing.  A label beginning with \"Q\" denotes a 2-dimensional space, whereas a label beginning with \"L\" denotes a 1-dimensional space.  The tuple itself represents a tensor product of the spaces denoted by it's elements, and so describes how to interpret a given dimension Hilbert space as the tensor product of 1- and 2-dimensional spaces.  For example, the tuple `('Q0',)` describes a 2-dimensional Hilbert space as that of a single qubit, and the tuple `('Q0','Q1')` describes a 4-dimensional Hilbert space as that of two qubit spaces tensored together.  Each tuple describes a single Hilbert-space *term* in the direct-sum decomposition of the entire Hilbert space, so the list `[('Q0','Q1'),('L0',)]` represents a Hilbert space that is the direct sum of a 4-dimensional and a 1-dimensional space; the 4-dimensional space is the a tensor product of two qubit spaces labelled 'Q0' and 'Q1' while the 1-dimensional space is labeled 'L0'.  (In this case, the corresponding state space dimensions list *must* be `[4,1]`, and is required as an argument to `build_vector` and `build_gate` just as a consistency check.)\n",
    "\n",
    "While specifying the state space in this way can seem overly cumbersome for small Hilbert spaces, it allows for great flexibility when moving to more complex spaces.  It is worthwhile to note that the state space labels described above are *only* used when interpreting the human-readable string used to specify gates and SPAM vectors in calls to `build_gate` and `build_vector`, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`build_vector` currently only understands strings which are integers (e.g. \"1\"), for which it creates a vector performing state preparation of (or, equivalently, a state projection onto) the $i^{th}$ state of the Hilbert space, that is, the state corresponding to the $i^{th}$ row and column of the $d\\times d$ density matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "`build_gate` accepts a wider range of descriptor strings, which take the form of *functionName*(*args*) and include:\n",
    "- `I(label0, label1, ...)` : the identity on the spaces labeled by `label0`, `label1`, etc.\n",
    "- `X(theta,Qlabel)`, `Y(theta,Qlabel)`, `Z(theta,Qlabel)` : single qubit X-, Y-, and Z-axis rotations by angle `theta` (in radians) on the qubit labeled by `Qlabel`.  Note that `pi` can be used within an expression for `theta`, e.g. `X(pi/2,Q0)`.\n",
    "- `CX(theta, Qlabel1, Qlabel2)`, `CY(theta, Qlabel1, Qlabel2)`, `CZ(theta, Qlabel1, Qlabel2)` : two-qubit controlled rotations by angle `theta` (in radians) on qubits `Qlabel1` (the control) and `Qlabel2` (the target).\n",
