    "# File Input and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how different pyGSTi objects can be saved to and read back from files.  There are four  main ways of doing this, depending on the type of object you're wanting to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom text formats** A small number of pyGSTi objects can be converted to and from a pyGSTi-specific text format, that can be written to and from files.  Currently `DataSet`, `MultiDataSet`, `Circuit`, and `Label` are the only such objects.  `Circuit` and `Label` objects are usually not read or written individually; usually it's a *list* of circuits that are.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JSON format** Many of pyGSTi's objects have the ability to be converted to and from the JavaScript object notation (JSON) format.  This is a standard text format that is widely supported and portable, making it the preferred choice for reading and writing just about any pyGSTi object except a data set or and circuit list (which have their own text formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiment design directory** Several high-level objects can be read and written from *directories* rather than individual files.  These include `ExperimentDesign`, `Protocol`, `ProtocolData`, `ProtocolResults`, and `ProtocolResultsDir` objects.  Because these object types hold lots of other objects, storing them to directories makes looking through the contents of the object possible without even using Python, since different parts of the object are stored in different files.  This is further facilitated by saving the parts of the high-level object in the custom text or JSON formats described above - the resulting directory contains portable, human-readable files.  \n",
    "   Secondly, this directory format allows for multiple of object types to effectively *share* a single directory. This is achieved by placing the data for an object in a subdirectory beneath the given directory named based on the object type.  For instance, writing an `ExperimentDesign` to the *path/to/root_directory* will write the object's contents within the *path/to/root_directory/edesign* directory.  A `ProtocolData`, which contains an `ExperimentDesign`, when writing to the same *path/to/root_directory* will write its non-experiment design contents within *path/to/root_directory/data* directory and re-use the serialized experiment design in the `edesign` sub-directory.  When experiment designs contain other (nested) experiment designs, this leads to an efficient tree structure organizing circuit lists, experimental data, and analysis results.   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pickle, basic JSON and MSGPACK formats**  Finally, most pyGSTi objects are able to be \"pickled\" using Python's pickle format.  The codec that allows for this can also write [JSON](https://www.json.org) and [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) formats via functions in `pygsti.io.json` and `pygsti.io.msgpack`.  These routines create an alternate format to the \"nice\" JSON format described above: they produce a format that is fragile, non-portable, and not human readable.  As such, using `pickle`, `pygsti.io.json` or `pygsti.io.msgpack` should be a last resort and only used for temporary storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text formats\n",
    "\n",
    "All text-based input and output is done via the `pygsti.io` sub-package.  Below we give examples of how to read and write data sets and circuit objects.  (Note: Data set objects also have `read_binary` and `write_binary` methods which read and write *binary* formats -- different from the text formats used by the `pygsti.io` routines -- but these binary formats are less portable and not human readable, making the text formats preferable)."
