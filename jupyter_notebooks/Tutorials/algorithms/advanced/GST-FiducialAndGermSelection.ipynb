    "# Fiducial and Germ Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to generate sets of fiducial and germ sequences which form the building blocks of the operation sequences used by long-sequence GST.  As described in [GST circuits tutorial](../../objects/advanced/GSTCircuitConstruction.ipynb), by structuring the GST sequences as\n",
    "\n",
    "`preparation_fiducial + repeated_germ + measurement_fiducial`\n",
    "\n",
    "long-sequence GST is highly sensitive to *all possible* (within the space of allowed models).  Furthermore, by iteratively increase the number of germ repetitions in `repeated_germ`, pyGSTi's iterative algorithms are able to avoid (usually!) local optima.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Both germ and fiducial sets are determined for a given \"target\" model.  We currently assume that this model contains unitary gates, such that infinitely many gates may be performed without moving away from a pure state.  It is almost always the case that the desired \"target\" operations are unitary, so this isn't a burdensome assumption.  If this isn't the case, one should find perform fiducial and germ selection on the nearest unitary model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fiducial Selection: the theory\n",
    "The purpose of the preparation and measurement fiducial sequences, $\\{F_i\\}$ and $\\{H_i\\}$, is to prepare a sufficiently diverse set of input states, and a sufficiently diverse set of measurements, to completely probe an operation of interest - defined as the map that lies *between* the fiducials.  This is achieved if (and only if) the input states $\\{\\rho_i\\}\\equiv  \\{F_i|\\rho\\rangle\\rangle\\}$ and the measurement effects $\\{E_j\\} \\equiv \\{\\langle\\langle E|H_j\\}$ are both *informationally complete* (IC).  A set of matrices is IC if and only if it spans the vector space of density matrices.  For a Hilbert space of dimension $d$ this requires at least $d^2$ linearly independent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, *any* randomly chosen set of $d^2$ states or effects will be IC.  So, for single-qubit GST, we could choose $d^2=4$ random fiducial sequences.  However, while the resulting $\\{\\rho_i\\}$ and $\\{E_j\\}$ will almost certainly be linearly independent, they may be *close* to linearly dependent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a set of fiducials we form a matrix $M$, which will allow us to quantify how linearly independent the resulting $\\{\\rho_i\\}$ or $\\{E_j\\}$ will be.  If we are evaluating a set of preparation fiducials, then the i^th column of $M$ is $F_i|\\rho\\rangle\\rangle$; if measurement fiducials, the columns are $\\langle\\langle E|H_i$.  This notation assumes a single native preparation or measurement effect; in the case when there are more this simply adds more columns $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then form the square matrix $MM^T$.  We either then score the fiducial set as the number of fiducials times the sum of the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $MM^T$ (`scoreFunc = 'all'`) or by the number of fiducials times the reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue of $MM^T$ (`scoreFunc = 'worst'`).  In both cases, a lower score is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `'all'` case, we are attempting to make all the fiducials as uniformly informationally complete as possible, that is, we are trying to make our fiducial set as sensitive as possible to all directions in Hilbert-Schmidt space.  In the `'worst'` case, we are instead attempting minimize our insensitivity to the direction in Hilbert-Schmidt space that we are least sensitive to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Germ Selection: the theory\n",
    "The defining property which makes a set of operation sequences a \"complete germ set\" is the amplification of *all* possible gate errors.  More precisely, the repetition of a complete set of germs, sandwiched between assumed-IC preparation and measurement fiducial sequences, will yield a sensitivity that scales with the number of times each germ is repeated to *any* direction in the space of `Models` (defined  by the model's parameterization).  This completeness is relative a \"target\" model, just as in fiducial selection.  While the detailed mathematics behind germ selection is beyond the scope of this tutorial, the essence of the algorithm is as follows.  The Jacobian $J$ of a potential set of germs relative to the target `Model`'s parameters is constructed and the eigenvalues of $J^\\dagger J$ are computed.  If the number of large eigenvalues values equals its maximum - the number of non-gauge `Model` parameters - then the germ set is deemed \"amplificationally complete\", and will amplify *any* gate error.  More specifically, a germ set is scored using a combination of 1) the number of eigenvalues values above some threshold and 2) either the `'all'` or `'worst'` scoring function applied to the eigenvalues of $J^\\dagger J$. Several technical points make this slightly more complicated:\n",
    "- only *gate* errors can be amplified, since only gates can be repeated.  Thus, when computing the number of non-gauge parameters of the target model, we really mean the target model without any SPAM operations.\n",
    "- typical perfect gates (e.g. $\\pi/2$ rotations) may contain symmetries which decrease the number of non-gauge parameters only at that perfect point in gate-set-space.  As such, we add random unitary perturbations to the target `Model` before performing the Jacobian analysis to mitigate the possibility of mischaracterizing a direction as being amplified when it isn't for all `Model`s except the perfect one.\n",
    "- In the Jacobian analysis, each germ is *twirled* to simulate the effect of it echoing out all directions except those that commute with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not all that made perfect sense, do not worry.  The remainder of this tutorial focuses on how to do fiducial or germ selection using pyGSTi, and does not rely on a rock solid theoretical understanding of the methods."
