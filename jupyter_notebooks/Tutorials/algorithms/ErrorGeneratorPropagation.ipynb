    "# Error Generator Propagation\n",
    "In this tutorial we will provide an overview of the core functionality available through pyGSTi's error generator propagation module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error generator propagation is a technique which leverages the analytical properties of the error generator formalism to enable efficient forward simulation by propagating general markovian error channels through Clifford circuits. Efficiency of this technique relies on two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sparsity: At most a polynomial number of error generator rates (in the number of qubits) can be nonzero for any given circuit layer.\n",
    "- Clifford-only: The propagation of error generators relies on the analytic properties of the elementary error generators when conjugated by cliffords.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is pretty much it though. Coherent errors, non-unital errors (e.g. amplitude damping), dephasing, all fair game. Practically there is a third requirement as well and that is that the error generator rates are relatively small. The larger the error generator rates, the higher-order the approximation you'll require (BCH and/or taylor series) to achieve a given precision target when using the functionality described herein for efficiently performing strong simulation in the error generator propagation framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note: The implementation of the error generator propagation framework in pyGSTi requires the `stim` python package, so please ensure this is installed in your environment before proceeding."

As such the first layer in the final output corresponds to the error generator associated with state prep, and the final one with measurement. We never actually specified error generator rates for the SPAM, so you'll notice the corresponding dictionaries in the final output are both empty in this case."

    "In addition to strong simulation of the output probabilities of computational basis states, it is also possible to compute approximate values for the expectation values of pauli observables. The main function for doing so is `approximate_stabilizer_pauli_expectation` from the `errgenproptools` module, the signature of which is nearly identical to that of `approximate_stabilizer_probability` described above, except taking instead a desired pauli observable to estimate the expectation value for. Here we'll again use the results of the second-order BCH approximation produced above and look are various order of the taylor series approximation for the pauli expectation value of 'XYZI' (the value for the ideal noise-free circuit is 1)."
