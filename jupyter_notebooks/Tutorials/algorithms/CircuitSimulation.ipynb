    "# Circuit Simulation\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to compute (simulate) the outcome probabilities of circuits in pyGSTi.  There are currently two basic ways to to this - but constructing and simulating a `Circuit` object, or by constructing and propagating a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method 1: `Circuit` simulation\n",
    "This is the primary way circuit simulation is done in pyGSTi.  `Model` objects are statistical models that predict the outcome probabilities of events, and (at least for all current model types) \"events\" are circuits, described by `Circuit` objects.  Thus, the three steps to simulating a circuit using this approach are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a `Model`\n",
    "2. create a `Circuit`\n",
    "3. call `model.probabilities(circuit)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Building models and circuits (steps 1 and 2) are largely covered in other tutorials (see the [essential objects tutorial](../01-EssentialObjects.ipynb), [circuits tutorial](../objects/Circuit.ipynb), and [explicit-op model](../objects/ExplicitModel.ipynb) and [implicit-op model](../objects/ImplicitModel.ipynb) tutorials).  This section focuses on step 3 and `Model` options which impact the way in which a model computes probabilities.  This approach to circuit simulation is most convenient when you have a large number of circuits which are known (and fixed) beforehand.\n",

The default method for 1- and 2-qubit models multiplies together dense process matrices, and is named `\"matrix\"` (because operations are *matrices*). The default method for 3+ qubit models performs sparse matrix-vector products, and is named `\"map\"` (because operations are abstract *maps*).  A `Model` is constructed for a single type of forward simulation, and it stores this within its `.simtype` member.  For more information on using different types of forward simulation see the [forward simulation types tutorial](algorithms/advanced/ForwardSimulationTypes.ipynb).\n",
