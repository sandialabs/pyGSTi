    "# Functions for Model Testing\n",
    "This tutorial covers different methods of **comparing data to given (fixed) QIP models**.  This is distinct from model-based *tomography*, which finds the best-fitting model for a data set within a space of models set by a `Model` object's parameterization.  You might use this as a tool alongside or separate from GST.  Perhaps you suspect that a given noisy QIP model is compatible with your data - model *testing* is the way to find out. Because there is no optimization involved, model testing requires much less time than GST does, and doens't place any requirements on which circuits are used in performing the test (though some circuits will give a more precise result).\n",

This essentially combines calls to `run_stdpractice_gst` and `Results.add_model_test` (demonstrated above) with the added control of being able to specify the ordering of the estimates via the `modes` argument.  To important remarks are in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *must* specify the names (keys of the `models_to_test` argument) of your test models in the comma-delimited string that is the `modes` argument.  Just giving a dictionary of `Model`s as `models_to_test` will not automatically test those models in the returned `Results` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You don't actually need to run any GST modes, and can use `run_stdpractice_gst` in this way to in one call create a single `Results` object containing multiple model tests, with estimate names that you specify.  Thus `run_stdpractice_gst` can replace the multiple `run_model_test` calls (with \"estimateLabel\" advanced options) followed by collecting the estimates using `Results.add_estimates` demonstrated under \"Method 1\" above.
