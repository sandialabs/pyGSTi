But it can be useful to randomized the \"target\" bit-string (e.g., then the asymptote in the RB decay is fixed to $1/2^n$ even with biased measurement errors). This randomization is specified via the `randomizeout` argument, and it defaults to `False` (the standard protocol)."

    "### 3. The Clifford compilation algorithm\n",
    "To generate a Clifford RB circuit in terms of native gates, it is necessary to decompose each $n$-qubit Clifford gate into the native gates. pyGSTi has a few different Clifford gate compilation algorithms, that can be accessed via the `compilerargs` optional argument. Note: **The Clifford RB error rate is compiler dependent!** So it is not possible to properly interpret the Clifford RB error rate without understanding at least some aspects of the compilation algorithm (e.g., the mean two-qubit gate count in a compiled $n$-qubit Clifford circuit). This is one of the reasons that [Direct RB](RB-DirectRB.ipynb) is arguably a preferable method to Clifford RB.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi are a simple look-up table with some optimized property (e.g., minimized two-qubit gate count or depth). Look-up tables like this are typically used for 1- and 2-qubit Clifford RB experiments, but we instead used a method that scales to many qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple compilation algorithms in pyGSTi, and the algorithm can be set using the `compilerargs` argument (see the `pygsti.algorithms.compile_clifford` function for some details on the available algorithms, and the `CliffordRBDesign` docstring for how to specify the desired algorithm). The default algorthm is the one that we estimate to be our \"best\" algorithm in the regime of 1-20ish qubits. This algorithm (and some of the other algorithms) are randomized. So when creating a `CliffordRBDesign` you can also specify the number of randomization, via `citerations`. Increasing this will reduce the average depth and two-qubit gate count of each $n$-qubit Clifford gate, up to a point, making Clifford RB feasable on more qubits. \n",
    "But note that time to generate the circuits can increase quickly as `citerations` increases (because a depth $m$ circuit contains $(m+2)$ $n$-qubit Clifford gates to compile)."
