    "# Idle tomography\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to run idle tomography on a multi-qubits system.  Idle tomography is a protocol which characterizes the errors present in an idle operation using data from a small number of intuitive circuits.  If $\\tilde{I}$ is the noisy idle operation being characterized and we write $\\tilde{I} = e^{\\Lambda}$, where we call $\\Lambda$ the *error generator* of $\\tilde{I}$, and we express $\\Lambda$ as a sum of terms, $\\Lambda = \\sum_i \\alpha_i F_i$, then idle tomography estimates the $\\alpha_i$ for some set of $F_i$.  The $F_i$ are specific generators for well-known errors (e.g. rotations or stochastic errors), the $\\alpha_i$ can roughly be interpreted as the error *rates* corresponding to the well-known error types.  The three classes of $F_i$ that pyGSTi's implementation of idle tomography estimates are (see the Lindblad operator section of the [tutorial on operators](../objects/advanced/Operators.ipynb) for more details):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hamiltonian**: $F_i = H_i$ where $H_i : \\rho \\rightarrow -i[P_i,\\rho]$\n",
    "- **Stochastic**: $F_i = S_i$ where $S_i : \\rho \\rightarrow P_i \\rho P_i - \\rho$\n",
    "- **Affine**: $F_i = A_i$ where $A_i : \\rho \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_{target})P_i \\otimes \\rho_{non-target}$\n",

    "## Creating idle tomography circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "To run idle tomography in pyGSTi you start by getting a list of the circuits you need to run.  This is done by specifying, similarly to in gate set tomography (GST), a target gate set (or model) along with a sequence of maximum-lengths.  The model is used to construct fiducial sequences that rotate a prepared qubit (ideally) onto each of the antipodal points on the Bloch sphere (this is done automatically by `determine_paulidicts`).  The maximum lengths determing how many successive idle operations to perform.  Similar to GST, repeating the idle is used to amplify errors.  In idle tomography, repeating the idle is useful as long as the errors are small enough that the higher-than-first-order errors are still small in the repeated gate.\n",

    "For this example, we'll need to generate some simulated data.  We just create a crosstalk-free model with weight-1 Hamiltonian and Stochastic $X$ errors on all the qubits using the `create_crosstalk_free_model` function.  (See the [implicit model tutorial](../objects/ImplicitModel.ipynb) for more details on building crosstalk-free models.)  Data can then be generated by simulating this model using `generate_fake_data`.  Note that the number of samples is quite high ($10^5$) - the current implementation of idle tomography in pyGSTi is suboptimal and requires more samples than are actually needed to achieve a given output accuracy, and this will be improved in future pyGSTi releases."
