A `Circuit` has some number of labeled *lines* and each gate label is assigned to one or more lines. Line labels can be integers or strings.   Gate labels have two parts: a `str`-type name and a tuple of line labels.  A gate name typically begins with 'G' because this is expected when we parse circuits from text files.\n",

There can also be a fourth type of layer called an *instrument layer* which we dicuss in a separate [tutorial on Instruments](objects/advanced/Instruments.ipynb).

    "In the above example, you saw how it is possible to manually add a layer-operation to an `ExplicitOpModel` based on its other, more primitive layer operations.  This often works fine for a few qubits, but can quickly become tedious as the number of qubits increases (since the number of potential layers that involve a given set of gates grows exponentially with qubit number).  This is where `ImplicitOpModel` objects come into play: these models contain rules for building up arbitrary layer-operations based on more primitive operations.  PyGSTi offers several \"built-in\" types of implicit models and a rich set of tools for building your own custom ones.  See the [tutorial on implicit models](objects/ImplicitModel.ipynb) for details. \n",
