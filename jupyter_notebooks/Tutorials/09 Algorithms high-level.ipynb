    "The `pygsti` package provides multiple levels of abstraction over the core Gate Set Tomography (GST) algorithms.  This  tutorial will show you how to work with `pygsti`'s highest level of abstraction, called \"driver functions\" to run GST algorithms with a minimial amount of effort.  In order to run a GST algorithm there are 3 essential ingredients: 1) data specifing the experimental outcomes, 2) a desired, or \"target\", `GateSet`, and 3) multiple lists of gate sequences, specifying the gate sequences to use at each successive step in the GST optimization.  There are currently only a few driver routines, which we'll cover in turn.  Each driver function returns a single `pygsti.objects.Results` object, which contains the *single* input `DataSet` and one or more *estimates* (`pygsti.objects.Estimate` objects). \n",
    "\n",
    "[The abbreviation \"LSGST\" (lowercase in function names to follow Python naming conventions) stands for \"Long Sequence Gate Set Tomography\", and refers to the more powerful flavor of GST that utilizes long sequences to find gate set estimates.  LSGST can be compared to Linear GST, or \"LGST\", which only uses short sequences and as a result provides much less accurate estimates.]"

    "The above example supplies the minimal amount of information required to run the long-sequence GST algorithm.  `do_long_sequence_gst` can be used in a variety of contexts and accepts additional (optional) arguments that affect the way the algorithm is run.  Here we make several remarks regarding alternate or more advanced usage of `do_long_sequence_gst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For many of the arguments, you can supply either a filename or a python object (e.g. dataset, target gateset, gate string lists), so if you find yourself loading things from files just to pass them in as arguments, you're probabaly working too hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typically we want to apply certain constraints to a GST optimization.  As mentioned in the gate set tutorial, the space over which a gate-set estimation is carried out is dictated by the parameterization of the `targetGateset` argument.  For example, to constrain a GST estimate to be trace-preserving, one should call `set_all_parameterizations(\"TP\")` on the target `GateSet` before calling `do_long_sequence_gst`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `gaugeOptParams` argument specifies a dictionary of parameters ultimately to be passed to the `gaugeopt_to_target` function (which provides full documentation).  By specifying an `itemWeights` argument we can set the ratio of the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) weighting to the gate weighting when performing a gauge optimization.  In the example below, the gate parameters are weighted 1000 times more relative to the SPAM parameters.  Mathematically this corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 0.001 preceding the sum-of-squared-difference terms corresponding to SPAM elements in the gateset.   Typically it is good to weight the gates parameters more heavily since GST amplifies gate parameter errors via long gate sequences but cannot amplify SPAM parameter errors.  If unsure, 0.001 is a good value to start with.  For more details on the arguments of `gaugeopt_to_target`, see the previous tutorial on low-level algorithms.\n",

This function provides a clean and simple interface to performing a \"usual\" set of GST analyses on a set of data.  As such, it takes a single `DataSet`, similar gate-sequence-specifying parameters to `do_long_sequence_gst`, and a new `modes` argument which is a comma-separated list of \"canned\" GST analysis types (e.g. `\"TP,CPTP\"` will compute a Trace-Preserving estimate *and* a Completely-Positive & Trace-Preserving estimate).

The former is can be either a string, specifying a standard \"suite\" of gauge optimizations, or a dictionary of dictionaries similar to the `gaugeOptParams` argument of `do_long_sequence_gst` (see docstring).  The `gaugeOptTarget` argument may be set to a `GateSet` that is used as the target for gauge optimization, overriding the (typically ideal) target gates given by the `targetGateFilenameOrSet` argument."
