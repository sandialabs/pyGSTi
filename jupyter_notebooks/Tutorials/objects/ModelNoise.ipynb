    "# Adding noise to models\n",

The procedure for specifying the noise is similar for the different types of models, though the types of noise allowed and how this noise is incorporated into the model's structure differ as we point out below."

    "## Standard noise types\n",
    "There are three standard types of noise that can be added to operations in pyGSTi: depolarization, stochastic, and Lindbladian.  The first two types are common in the literature, while the third, \"Lindbladian\", needs a bit more explanation.  Many types of gate errors can be represented in terms of an *error generator*.  If $G$ is a noisy gate (a CPTP map) and $G_0$ is it's ideal counterpart, then if we write $G = e^{\\Lambda}G_0$ then $\\Lambda$ is called the gate's *error generator*.  A `LindbladErrorgen` object, exponentiated using a `ExpErrorgenOp` object represent this $e^{\\Lambda}$ in pyGSTi.  If we write $\\Lambda$ as a sum of terms, $\\Lambda = \\sum_i \\alpha_i F_i$ then, when the $F_i$ are specific generators for well-known errors (e.g. rotations or stochastic errors), the $\\alpha_i$ can roughly be interpreted as the error *rates* corresponding to the well-known error types.  PyGSTi has three specific generator types (where $P_i$ is a Pauli operator or tensor product of Pauli operators):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hamiltonian**: $F_i = H_i$ where $H_i : \\rho \\rightarrow -i[P_i,\\rho]$\n",
    "- **Stochastic**: $F_i = S_i$ where $S_i : \\rho \\rightarrow P_i \\rho P_i - \\rho$\n",
    "- **Affine**: $F_i = A_i$ where $A_i : \\rho \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho_{target})P_i \\otimes \\rho_{non-target}$\n",
    "\n",
    "See our recent paper on [the taxonomy of small errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01928v1) for a more theoretical foundation of error generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the model construction functions take arguments that allow users to add these standard noise types conveniently when a model is created.  Each argument expects a dictionary, where the keys are gate names and the values specify the corresponding noise. The values are different types for each argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `depolarization_strengths`: Values are floats, which corresponding to strengths of a `DepolarizeOp`\n",
    "- `stochastic_error_probs`: Values are lists of length $4^{N_{qubits} - 1}$, which correspond to coefficients of a stochastic Pauli channel in a `StochasticNoiseOp`. Order of the rates is lexographical, and can be checked by looking at the elements of a `\"pp\"` Basis object.\n",
    "- `lindblad_error_coeffs`: Values are a dict where the key has the form `(<type>, <basis_elements>)` and the values are the $\\alpha_i$ coefficients in the sum of Lindblad terms, which are then exponentiated to give the final noise. The type includes:\n",
    "  - `'H'` for Hamiltonian errors\n",
    "  - `'S'` for Pauli-stochastic and Pauli-correlation errors (S and C in the error generator taxonomy)\n",
    "  - `'A'` for affine errors\n",

    "#### Stencils\n",
    "When there are many qubits, it can be tedious to specify non-local noise in the way shown above since you need to specify the qubits upon which the noise acts differently for each primitive layer operation.  For example, if we have a chain of 10 qubits and want an $X(\\pi/2)$ gate to depolarize the qubit to the left and right of the gate's target qubit, we would need to specify nonlocal noise on qubits 1 and 3 for $X(\\pi/2)$ on qubit 2, nonlocal noise on qubits 2 and 4 for $X(\\pi/2)$ on qubit 3, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stencils* have been developed to make this process easier.  `ProcessorSpec` objects can contain a `QubitGraph` giving the geometry of the processor (or, more accurately, of an API of the processor).  This graph can include tags that associate a *direction name* with each of its edges.  For example, the built-in (and default) linear chain (`\"line\"`) graph has two directions, \"left\" and \"right\".  When specifying non-local noise, instead of specifying absolute qubit names, you can specify *relative qubit labels*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of relative qubit labels - or *stencil labels* as they're called in pyGSTi - causes noise to be placed on qubits relative to a gate's target qubits.  The format of a stencil label is:\n",

This is significant when the model will be tweaked or optimized later on, in which case the paramterization determines how the noise operations are allowed to be tweaked (changed).  Parameterization types are especially important in cloud noise models where this constitutes the entirety of how the model is parameterized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameterizations for the three standard noise types are given by specifying the `depolarization_parameterization`, `stochastic_parameterization`, and `lindblad_parameterization` arguments.  The options for these are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `depolarization_parameterization`:\n",
    "    - `\"depolarize\"` (default) builds `DepolarizeOp` objects with the strength given in `depolarization_strengths`.  A `DepolarizeOp` object contains a single parameter for the depolarization rate.\n",
    "    - `\"stochastic\"` builds `StochasticNoiseOp` objects, which have separate parameters for each Pauli stochastic error rate, all of which are initially equal.  The depolarization strength is thus split evenly among the individual Pauli stochastic channels of a `StochasticNoiseOp`.\n",
    "    - `\"lindblad\"` builds exponentiated `LindbladErrorgen` object containing Pauli stochastic terms.  The error generator object is built with `parameterization=\"D\"` (an argument of `LindbladErrorgen.__init__`).  We will refer to this as the *mode* of the `LindbladErrorgen`.  `\"D\"` (depolarization) mode means it that has a single parameter is squared to give the depolarization rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stochastic_parameterization`:\n",
    "    - `\"stochastic\"` (default) builds `StochasticNoiseOp` objects which have separate parameters for each Pauli stochastic error rate.  Elements of `stochastic_error_probs` are used as coefficients in a linear combination of individual Pauli stochastic channels.\n",
    "    - `\"lindblad\"` builds exponentiated `LindbladErrorgen` object containing Pauli stochastic terms.  The error generator object is built in `\"CPTP\"` mode, which means it that there is one parameter per stochastic rate (equal to the square root of the rate so it is constrained to be positive).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- `lindblad_parameterization`:  Lindblad errors are always represented by exponentiated `LindbladErrorgen` objects.  A `LindbladErrorgen` can have several different internal parameterizations, or *modes* as we refer to them here to avoid confusion with the noise or model parameterization.  The mode is by definition the value of the `parameterization` argument supplied to `LindbladErrorgen.__init__`, which influences what types of elementary error generators (e.g. 'H', 'S', 'C' and 'A') are allowed and whether the Pauli stochastic error rates are constrained to be positive. The value of `lindblad_parameterization` can be set to any valid mode value (see documentation for more details).  Usually the default values of `\"auto\"` is fine. \n",
