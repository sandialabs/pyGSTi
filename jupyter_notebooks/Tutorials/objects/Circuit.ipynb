    "Gate labels represent a single gate within a circuit, like a CNOT operation between two qubits. A gate label has two parts: a `str`-type name and a tuple of line labels.  Gate names typically begin with 'G' because this is expected when we parse circuits from text files.  The line labels assign the gate to those lines in the circuit.  For example, `\"Gx\"` or `\"Gcnot\"` are common gate names, and the integers 0 to $n$ might be the available line labels.  We can make a proper gate label by creating a instance of the `Label` class:"

    "**1Q Note:** Particularly within the 1-qubit context the **ordering direction** is important.  The elements of a `Circuit` are read from **left-to-right**, meaning the first (left-most) layer is performed first.  This is very natural for experiments since one can read the operation sequence as a script, executing each gate as one reads from left to right.  It's also natural for 2+ qubit circuits which similar to standard quantum circuit diagrams.  However, for 1-qubit circuits, since we insist on \"normal\" matrix multiplication conventions, the fact that the ordering of matrix products is *reversed* from that of operation sequences may be confusing.  For example, the circuit `('Ga','Gb','Gc')`, in which Ga is performed first, corresponds to the matrix product $G_c G_b G_a$.  The probability of this operation sequence for a SPAM label associated with the (column) vectors ($\\rho_0$,$E_0$) is given by $E_0^T G_c G_b G_a \\rho_0$, which can be interpreted as \"prepare state 0 first, then apply gate A, then B, then C, and finally measure effect 0\".  While this nuance is typically hidden from the user (the `Model` functions which compute products and probabilities from `Circuit` objects perform the order reversal internally), it becomes very important if you plan to perform matrix products by hand. \n",

This conversion is automatic for circuits that containing only gates with name that are in-built into `pyGSTi` (the docstring of `pygsti.tools.internalgates.get_standard_gatename_unitaries()`). This is with some exceptions in the case of Quil: currently not all of the in-built gate names can be converted to quil gate names automatically, but this will be fixed in the future. \n",
