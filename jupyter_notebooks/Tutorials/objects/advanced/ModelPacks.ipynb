    "# Tutorial on pyGSTi \"model packs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi comes shipped with a number of \"model packs\", each of which contains a small (few-qubit) noise model and related information.  This related information is typically *derived* from the base noise model, but it's computation is nontrivial or inconvenient.  The convenience of having meta-data packaged together with the base model is the sole reason for model packs in pyGSTi. \n",

    "Model-packs look like modules and you import them from `pygsti.modelpacks` in the usual way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Model packs are a new addition to pyGSTi.  Previously, \"standard modules\" were used, which served a similar purpose but held models that were less extensible to multi-qubit systems.  If you need to use the old `std`-prefixed modules, they're now located within `pygsti.modelpacks.legacy`.\n",

A model pack's model always contains *perfect* (unitary) operations, and is called the *target model* because often times this is the model you wish described your system.

    "## Quantities for running GST\n",
    "In addition to a target `Model`, a GST-type model pack (most of them are this type) contains a number of `Circuit` list generating functions used for running Gate Set Tomography (GST).  All of these functions (like `target_model`) take a `qubit_labels` argument that can specify a non-default set of qubit labels to use.  The circuit-list functions include:\n",
    "- preparation fiducials: `prep_fiducials`\n",
    "- measurement (effect) fiducials: `meas_fiducials`\n",
    "- germ sequences: `germs`\n",
    " - this function has an additional `lite` argument that, when True (the default) gives a shorter list of germ circuits that amplify all the errors in the target model to *first order*.  This is usually all that is needed to achieve the high-accuracy typically desired from GST results, and so we recommend starting with this list of germs since it's shorter.  When `lite=False` a longer list of germ circuits is returned that amplify all the errors in the target model to *higher orders*.  Although typically unnecessary, this \"paranoid\" set of germs can be particularly helpful when you expect and don't care about some departures (errors) from the target model.\n",
    "- fiducial pair reductions (see the [circuit reduction tutorial](../../algorithms/advanced/GST-FiducialPairReduction.ipynb) for more details):\n",
    " - `global_fid_pairs` is not a function, but just a list of 2-tuples giving the indices (within `prep_fiducials` and `meas_fiducials`) of the fiducial circuits to keep when implementing global fiducial pair reduction.\n",
    " - `pergerm_fidpair_dict` and `pergerm_fidpair_dict_lite` are dictionaries of lists-of-2-tuples giving the indices of the fiducial circuits to keep on a per-germ basis (dict keys are germ circuits) when implementing per-germ fiducial pair reduction.\n",
