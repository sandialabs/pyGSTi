    "# Matrix Basis Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the space of density matrices corresponding to a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ of dimension $d$.  The basis used for this Hilbert-Schmidt space, $B(\\mathcal{H})$, can be any set of $d\\times d$ matrices which span the density matrix space.  pyGSTi supports arbitrary bases by deriving from the `pygsti.tools.Basis` class, and constains built-in support for the following basis sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the matrix unit, or \"standard\" basis, consisting of the matrices with a single unit (1.0) element and otherwise zero.  This basis is selected by passing `\"std\"` to appropriate function arguments.\n",
    "- the Pauli-product basis, consisting of tensor products of the four Pauli matrices {I, X, Y, Z} normalized so that $Tr(B_i B_j) = \\delta_{ij}$.  All of these matrices are Hermitian, so that Hilbert-Schmidt vectors and matrices are real when this basis is used. This basis can only be used when the $d = 4^i$ for integer $i$, and is selected using the string `\"pp\"`.\n",
    "- the Gell-Mann basis, consisting of the normalized Gell-Mann matrices (see Wikipedia if you don't know what these are).  Similar to the Pauli-product case, these matrices are also Hermitian, so that Hilbert-Schmidt vectors and matrices are real when this basis is used.  Unlike the Pauli-product case, since Gell-Mann matrices are well defined in any dimension, the Gell-Mann basis is *not* restricted to cases when $d=4^i$.  This basis is selected using the string `\"gm\"`.\n",
    "- a special basis of $3 \\times 3$ matricies designed for Qutrit systems formed by taking the symmetric subspace of a 2-qubit system.  This basis is selected using the string `\"qt\"`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various functions and objects within pyGSTi require knowledge of what Hilbert-Schmidt basis is being used.  The `pygsti.objects.Basis` object encapsulates a basis, and is the most flexible way of specifying a basis in pyGSTi.  Alternatively, many functions also accept the short strings `\"std\"`, `\"gm\"`, `\"pp\"`, and `\"qt\"` to select one of the standard bases.  In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to create a `Basis` object and use it and related functions to obtain and change the basis of the operation matrices and SPAM vectors stored in a `Model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to create a `Basis` object is to provide its short name and dimension to the `Basis.cast` function, which \"casts\" various things as a basis object.  PyGSTi contains built-in support for bases consisting of the tensor product of Pauli matrices (or just the Pauli matrices in the case of 1 qubit), named `\"pp\"`, as well as the Gell-Mann matrices, named `\"gm\"`.  It also contains a special \"qutrit\" basis, named `\"qt\"`, for the case of 3-level quantum systems.  In cases when there are an integral number of qubits, and the dimension equals $4^N$, the `\"pp\"` basis is usually preferred since it is more intuitive.  In other cases, where the Hilbert space includes non-qubit (e.g. environmental) degrees of freedom, the Gell-Mann basis may be useful since it can be used in any dimension.  Note that both the Gell-Mann and Pauli-Product bases reduce to the usual Pauli matrices plus identity in when the dimension equals 4 (1 qubit).\n",
