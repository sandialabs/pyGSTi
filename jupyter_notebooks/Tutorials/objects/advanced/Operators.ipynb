    "# Tutorial on operators (SPAM, gate, and layer operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the objects that represent state preparation, measurement, gate, and layer operations in pyGSTi.  These objects form the essential components of `Model` objects in pyGSTi, and are therefore an important topic to understand if you're creating your own models or just need to know how to extract specific information from a `Model`.  We use the term *operator* generically all such objects, even when gate or layer operators act on vectorized density matrices and are therefore *super-operators*. \n",
    "\n",
    "State preparations and POVM effects are represented as *vectors* in pyGSTi.  For $n$ qubits, these can be either length-$2^n$ complex vectors representing pure states/projections or length-$4^n$ real vectors representing mixed states (in the Liouville picture, where we vectorize a $2^n\\times 2^n$ density matrix into a column or row vector).  Gate and layer operations are represented as *linear maps* on the space of state vectors.  As such these can be viewed as $2^n\\times 2^n$ complex matrices (in the pure-state case) or $4^n \\times 4^n$ real matrices (in the mixed-state case).\n",

    "State and effect vectors are subclasses of `pygsti.modelmembers.states.State` and `pygsti.modelmembers.povms.POVMEffect` respectively.  In both cases the vector is stored as a *column* vector even though effect (co-)vectors are perhaps more properly row vectors (this improves code reuse).  Measurement (POVM) objects, which are basically dictionaries of effect vectors, are subclasses of `pygsti.modelmembers.povms.POVM`.  Gate and layer operator objects are subclasses of `pygsti.modelmembers.operations.LinearOperator`.  All of these classes (`State`, `POVMEffect`, `POVM`, and `LinearOperator`) are derived from `ModelMember` which forms the base for all of pyGSTi's model components.  All `ModelMember` objects have a `state_space` attribute, which specifies the Hilbert or Hilbert-Schmidt space that they act upon.  A state space can describe this space in multiple ways: by a number of qubits $n$ (`num_qubits` attribute), a unitary operator dimension $2^n$ (`udim`) or a superoperator dimension $4^n$ (`dim`).\n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest kind of operators look very similar to numpy arrays (like those we created above) in which some of the elements are read-only.  These operators derive from `DenseOperator` or `DenseState` and hold a *dense* representation, meaning the a dense vector or matrix is stored in memory.  **SPAM, gate, and layer operators have parameters which describe how they can be varied**, essentially the \"knobs\" which you can turn.  `Model` objects also have *parameters* that are essentially inherited from their contained operators.  How an operator is parameterized is particularly relevant for protocols which optimize a `Model` over its parameter space (e.g. Gate Set Tomography).  See the tutorial on [model parameterization](ModelParameterization.ipynb) for more information.  Three common parameterizations are:\n",
    "- **static**: the object has *no* (zero) parameters, so the object cannot be changed at all.  Static operators are like read-only NumPy arrays.\n",
    "- **full**: the object has one independent parameter for each element of its (dense) vector or matrix.  Fully parameterized objects are like normal NumPy arrays.\n",
    "- **trace-preserving (TP)**: similar to full, except the top row of gate/layer matrices and the first element of state preparation vectors is fixed and these elements are therefore not parameters.  (A POVM that is trace preserving must have all of its effect vectors sum to the identity.)\n",

Additional elements in the tuple are basis-element labels (often strings of I, X, Y, and Z), which reference basis matrices in the `Basis` that is returned when `return_basis=True`.

That is, state preparations are $e^{\\mathcal{L}} |\\rho_0\\rangle\\rangle$, where $|\\rho_0\\rangle\\rangle$ represents a \"base\" pure state, and effect vectors are $\\langle\\langle E_i | e^{\\mathcal{L}}$ where $\\langle\\langle E_i|$ are the effects of a \"base\" POVM.

    "\n",
    "PyGSTi makes it possible to build up \"large\" (e.g. complex or many-qubit) operators from other \"smaller\" ones. We have already seen a modest example of this above when an `ExpErrorgenOp` was constructed from a `LindbladErrorgen` object.  Two common and useful actions for building large operators are:\n",
    "1. **Composition**: A `ComposedOp` composes zero or more other operators, and therefore it's action is the sequential application of each of its *factors*.  The dense representation of a `ComposedOp` is equal to the product (in reversed order!) of the dense representations of its factors.  Note that a `ComposedOp` does not, however, require that its factors have dense representations - they can be *any* `LinearOperator` objects. The dense versions of operators can sometimes result in faster calculations when the system size (qubit number) is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding**: An `EmbeddedOp` maps an operator on a subsystem of a state space to the full state space.  For example, it could take a 1-qubit $X(\\pi/2)$ rotation and make a 3-qubit operation in which this operation is applied to the 2nd qubit.  Embedded operators are very useful for constructing layer operations in multi-qubit models, where we naturally prefer to work with the lower-dimensional (typically 1- and 2-qubit) operations and need to build up $n$-qubit *layer* operations.\n",

(These three operations *happen* to all be $X(\\pi/2)$ gates because we're lazy and didn't bother to use `gate_mx` values in our examples above, but they *could* be entirely different.)
