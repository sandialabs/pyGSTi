    "# Results Object Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial explains the structure and usage of the \"results\" objects (derived from `pygsti.protocols.ProtocolResults`).  These objects are returned from a `Protocol` object's `.run(...)` method and thus constitute the main way results are communicated back to the user in pyGSTi.  A `ProtocolResults` object is used to store results corresponding to a given *experiment design* and its accompanying data (packaged together into a `ProtocolData` object).  A result object's `.data` attribute holds the `ProtocolData` associated with it, and its `.protocol` attribute holds the `Protocol` that created the results. \n",

As the summary states, `.estimates` is a *dictionary* of `Estimate` objects, and **can contain as multiple estimates of the data *with the caveat* that all of these estimates must use the same experiment design** (roughly, the same `Circuit` lists and/or `CircuitStructure`s for each algorithm iteration, and the same number of iterations).\n",

    "`Estimate` objects do *not* store the operation sequences - rather, since these must be the same for all the estimates of a `Results` object, the `Results` object holds them separately in its `.circuit_lists` and `.circuit_structs` members (both of which are dictionaries like `.estimates`).  Furthermore, since varying the gauge optimization parameters is such a common variation, a single `Estimate` may hold *multiple* dictionaries of gauge-optimization parameters as the elements of its `.goparameters` dictionary.  **The keys of `goparameters` will and must correspond to keys within the `.models` member** (the `Model` estimate of that gauge optimization).  The `.confidence_regions` dictionary (empty in the above example and so not included in the summary) holds `ConfidenceRegion` objects, each associated with 1) one the `Model`s in `.models`, 2) one of the `Circuit` lists in the parent `Results` object's `.circuit_lists`, and 3) a confidence level.  The keys of `.confidence_regions` are complicated because they must include all three of these associations, and so the `.confidence_region(...)` method is preferred to directly accessing `.confidence_regions`.  Different `Estimate` objects typically hold estimates for different model parameterizations and/or algorithm parameters.\n",

    "## Creating a new gauge-optimized estimate\n",
    "In many circumstances, one may want to perform a new gauge optimization on an existing gauge-unfixed `Estimate`, `est`, creating a new gauge-optimized `Model` to be stored in `est`.  This is accomplished using the `est.add_gaugeoptimized` which lightly wraps a call to `pygsti.gaugeopt_to_target`.  You specify the arguments to `gaugeopt_to_target` as a dictionary to `add_gaugeoptimized`, but you're allowed to leave out the first two: the `Model` to be optimized, (`model`, taken to be the `est.models['final iteration estimate']`) and the model to optimize toward (`target_model`, taken to be the `est.models['target']`).  Note that these arguments *can* still be specified to override their defaults.  In particular, **setting `target_model` in the dictionary of parameters allows one to independently specify the model to optimize toward** (*and this need not be a perfect, ideal model!*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional `label` argument of `add_gaugeoptimized` specifies the key within `est.goparameters` and `est.models` where the gauge optimization argument dictionary and resulting gauge-optimized `Model` will be stored.  If the label given already exists, that gauge-optimized estimate is replaced with the new one.  If `label` is left as `None`, then \"go*X*\" is used as the label, where *X* is the next available integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `model` argument of `add_gaugeoptimized` is supplied, then this is taken to be the result of the described gauge optimization and no call to `gaugeopt_to_target` is made.  (In this case, one could simply pass an empty dictionary of as `goparams`.)\n",

    "## Confidence Region Factories\n",
    "In order to compute confidence regions and intervals within reports (see later tutorials), an `Estimate` object must be equipped with one or more \"confidence region factory\" objects.  These factories are instances of `pygsti.objects.ConfidenceRegionFactory` (suprise, suprise).  Their purpose is to generate confidence regions and intervals (for *any* confidence level) for quantities computed from a particular `Model` that in turn resulted from optimizing the likelihood function corresponding to a particular set of circuits.  Thus, a confidence region factory has associated with it three things: 1) a `Model`, 2) a list of `Circuit`s, and 3) a `DataSet`.  A dictionary of factories is held as the `.confidence_region_factories` member of an `Estimate` object.  Each factory within this dictionary is associated with the one-and-only `DataSet` of the `Estimate`'s parent `ModelEstimateResults` object, and the associated `Model` and `Circuit` list are given by the keys of `.confidence_region_factories` (*model-key*, *circuit-list-key* tuples).  Here *model-key* is the key of a `Model` within the `Estimate`'s `.models` member and *circuit-list key* is the key of a list within the parent `ModelEstimateResults` object's `.circuit_lists` member.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, you won't usually need to deal with the `.confidence_region_factories` member directly. To create a new factory for a given `Model`, `Circuit`-list pair you can simply call the `add_confidence_region_factory` with the appropriate key labels.  Once a factory is created, it must be initialized for computing confidence regions.  The only non-experimental way to do this currently is to compute the Hessian of the log-likelihood (often computationally intensive) and then projecting the inverse of this Hessian onto the non-gauge space of the model.  These two steps are performed via the `compute_hessian` and `project_hessian` member functions of a `ConfidenceRegionFactory` object.  "
