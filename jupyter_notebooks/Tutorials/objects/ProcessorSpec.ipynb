    "# Processor Specifications\n",
    "This tutorial covers the creation and use of processor specification objects.  These objects are used to define the application programming interface (API) exposed by a quantum information processor (QIP).  Currently, processor specifications in pyGSTi are restricted to QIPs with a given number of *qubits* (`QubitProcessorSpec`), though in the future support may be added for more exotic processor types containing, for example qudits or a mix of qubits and classical bits.  Often a processor specification is created for the \"primitive\" gates of the device, though it can be useful to create processor specifications for \"compiled\" gates as well."

    "A `QubitProcessorSpec` object specifies the API of a quantum computer in terms of operations on some number of qubits.  It holds three main quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of qubits in the device, and, optionally, the labels of these qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The gate operations allowed on the qubits.  Gates are specified by associating labels with (usually 1- or 2-qubit) unitary matrices.  Common gate labels are recognized by pyGSTi (e.g. `\"Gxpi2\"` specifies a 1-qubit $X(\\pi/2)$ rotation gate). Non-built-in gate names must be accompanied by a corresponding unitary matrix.  Continuously-parameterized gates (e.g. a $z$-rotation by an arbitrary angle) can be specified by supplying a *function* that returns a unitary matrix instead.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The availability of the gates (possibly via the connectivity of the device).  Sets of the allowed target qubit labels for each gate specify where in the processor each gate name can be applied.  Alternatively, special values such as `\"all-edges\"` can be used in conjunction with a `QubitGraph` object that gives the connectivity of the qubits. \n",

    "## Idle gates\n",
    "Specifying idle gates within processor specifications can be done in various ways, and this can sometimes lead to confusion regarding how these idles are modeled in circuits.  Here are two common ways to specify idle operations in a processor spec:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single-qubit idle gate, e.g. `\"Gi\"`, is specified with availability on each qubit.  This is the simplest approach, as the idle appears just as another 1-qubit gate.  This works well with implicit models, that compose the potentially noisy 1-qubit idles into layer operations just like any other gate.  In explicit models every gate is treated as a separate layer, and so the resulting model will have multiple N-qubit idle layers (one per  qubit, e.g. labelled by `(\"Gi\", 0)`, `(\"Gi\", 1)`, etc.).  This may be desirable in some cases, but more often just a single idle layer is desired when working with explicit models (see next item).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A N-qubit global idle gate is specified.  This can be done by specifying any gate name, e.g. `\"Gwait\"`, and setting its `nonstd_gate_unitaries` entry to a $2^N \\times 2^N$ identity matrix **or to the integer $N$**.  Setting elements of `nonstd_gate_unitaries` to integers indicates that this gate label has target equal to the $N$-qubit identity matrix, but that this matrix should not actually be built unless absolutely necessary (this is useful when $N$ is large and constructing $2^N \\times 2^N$ matrices is impractical).  If an \"idle\"-containing gate name, e.g. `\"Gidle\"`, is used, then pyGSTi behaves as though `nonstd_gate_unitaries` was set to $N$ by default and there is no need to provide this information.  The availability for a global idle gate can be specified as, e.g., `{'Gidle': [(0,1,...N)], ...}` or `{'Gidle': [None]}` (which one depends on how you want to refer to the layer in circuits -  as `\"Gidle:0:1:..N\"` or just `\"Gidle\"`).  If left unspecified the default availability for a \"idle\"-containing gate name is `[None]`.  When implicit models are constructed they will often (see model construction function arguments for details) automatically detect a global idle operation in the processor spec and associate it (via \"layer rules\") with the empty-layer label (the empty tuple `()` or string `\"[]\"`) that conventionally designates a idle layer in circuits. In the explicit model case, however, this automatic association is not performed, and an empty-layer label operation must be added explicitly via a parenthesized idle gate name (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Various algorithms in pyGSTi iterate over a model's \"primitive operations\".  Sometimes an idle gate, especially when it's a global idle gate, should not be considered one of these operations, as it is undesirable to have the idle gate reported or processed alongside all of the other gates.  Choosing a gate name in parentheses, e.g., `\"(idle)\"`, indicates to the `ProcessorSpec` and subsequently created models that this gate is \"hidden\" and should not be included when listing primitive operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**There is one special case regarding parenthesized gate names:** when an `ExpilcitModel` is built, e.g., using `create_explicit_model`, and the supplied processor specification has a global idle gate with parenthesized name, then this idle gate will be associated to the empty-layer label in the created model and the parenthesized name will not exist within the model.  This special behavior makes it convenient to construct explicit models with an empty-layer operation (note that all the gate names in a `QubitProcessorSpec` must be simple strings and cannot be empty or non-empty layer labels). \n",

    "`QubitProcessorSpec` objects are primarily used for creating models and experiment designs.  Most of the functions for creating models (see the [explicit model tutorial](ExplicitModel.ipynb) and [implicit model tutorial](ImplicitModel.ipynb)) take as their first argument a processor specification.  Processor specifications are also used to construct randomized benchmarking (RB) experiment designs (see the [Clifford](../algorithms/RB-CliffordRB.ipynb), [Direct](../algorithms/RB-DirectRB.ipynb) and [Mirror](../algorithms/RB-MirrorRB.ipynb) RB tutorials) as well as in gate set tomography experiment designs."
