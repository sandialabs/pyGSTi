    "# Data Sets Tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to create and use `DataSet` objects.  PyGSTi uses `DataSet` objects to hold experimental or simulated data in the form of outcome counts.  When a `DataSet` is used to hold time-independent data (the typical case, and all we'll look at in this tutorial), it essentially looks like a nested dictionary which associates operation sequences with dictionaries of (outcome-label,count) pairs so that `dataset[circuit][outcomeLabel]` can be used to read & write the number of `outcomeLabel` outcomes of the experiment given by the circuit `circuit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important differences between a `DataSet` and a dictionary-of-dictionaries:\n",
    "- `DataSet` objects can be in one of two modes: *static* or *non-static*.  When in *non-static* mode, data can be freely modified within the set, making this mode to use during the data-entry.  In the *static* mode, data cannot be modified and the `DataSet` is essentially read-only.  The `done_adding_data` method of a `DataSet` switches from non-static to static mode, and should be called, as the name implies, once all desired data has been added (or modified).  Once a `DataSet` is static, it is read-only for the rest of its life; to modify its data the best one can do is make a non-static *copy* via the `copy_nonstatic` member and modify the copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because `DataSet`s may contain time-dependent data, the dictionary-access syntax for a single outcome label (i.e. `dataset[circuit][outcomeLabel]`) *cannot* be used to write counts for new `circuit` keys; One should instead  use the `add_`*xxx* methods of the `DataSet` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a `DataSet` is constructed, filled with data, and made *static*, it is typically passed as a parameter to one of pyGSTi's algorithm or driver routines to find a `Model` estimate based on the data.  This tutorial focuses on how to construct a `DataSet` and modify its data.  Later tutorials will demonstrate the different GST algorithms."

    "## Creating a `DataSet`\n",
    "There three basic ways to create `DataSet` objects in `pygsti`:\n",
    "* By creating an empty `DataSet` object and manually adding counts corresponding to operation sequences.  Remember that the `add_`*xxx* methods must be used to add data for operation sequences not yet in the `DataSet`.  Once the data is added, be sure to call `done_adding_data`, as this restructures the internal storage of the `DataSet` to optimize the access operations used by algorithms.\n",
    "* By loading from a text-format dataset file via `pygsti.io.load_dataset`.  The result is a ready-to-use-in-algorithms *static* `DataSet`, so there's no need to call `done_adding_data` this time.\n",
    "* By using a `Model` to generate \"fake\" data via `generate_fake_data`. This can be useful for doing simulations of GST, and comparing to your experimental results.\n",
    "\n",

This is because outcome labels in pyGSTi are tuples of time-ordered instrument element (see the [intermediate measurements tutorial](advanced/Instruments.ipynb)) and POVM effect labels.  In the special but common case when there are no intermediate measurements, the outcome label is a 1-tuple of just the final POVM effect label.  In this case, one may use the effect label itself (e.g. `'0'` or `'1'`) in place of the 1-tuple in almost all contexts, as it is automatically converted to the 1-tuple (e.g. `('0',)` or `('1',)`) internally.  When printing, however, the 1-tuple is still displayed to remind the user of the more general structure contained in the `DataSet`."

The former instructs the `DataSet` to simply add the counts of like outcomes when counts are added for an already existing gate sequence.  `\"keepseparate\"`, on the other hand, causes the `DataSet` to tag added count data by appending a fictitious `\"#<n>\"` operation label to a gate sequence that already exists, where `<n>` is an integer.  When retreiving the keys of a `keepseparate` data set, the `stripOccuranceTags` argument to `keys()` determines whether the `\"#<n>\"` labels are included in the output (if they're not - the default - duplicate keys may be returned).  Access to different occurances of the same data are provided via the `occurrance` argument of the `get_row` and `set_row` functions, which should be used instead of the usual bracket indexing."
