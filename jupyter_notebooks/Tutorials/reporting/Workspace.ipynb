    "# Introduction to `Workspace` objects\n",
    "This tutorial briefly explains how pyGSTi visualizes data using `Workspace` objects.  Understanding the basics covered here will help demystify the creation of plots and tables in other tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGSTi prefers to use HTML-based figures (native HTML tables and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) plots) over the perhaps more traditional LaTeX tables and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) plots.  There are several reasons for this:\n",
    "1. Interactivity - HTML allows plots and tables to be interactive; with LaTeX this is impossible and with matplotlib it's painful.\n",
    "2. HTML's ability to be integrated into web pages (making nicer reports than a many-page PDF) and into Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "3. Portability - Plotly figures (HTML and JS) can be more robustly stored and transported (e.g. over the web) than matplotlib `Figure` objects, which are difficult even to pickle with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of (HTML) figures, both tables and plots, is handled by the `pygsti.report.Workspace` factory object."

The [report generation tutorial](ReportGeneration.ipynb) demonstrates how the automated use of a `Workspace` can lead to a standalone HTML report."
