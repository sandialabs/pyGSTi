    "This tutorial demonstrates how to generate Clifford randomized benchmarking (RB) circuits using `pygsti`. We will focus on (holistic) Clifford RB for an arbitrary number of qubits. The tutorial uses an in-built Clifford compilation algorithm that works for an arbitrary number of qubits, but does not permit the user to specify their own Clifford compilation. We  follow the current standard RB protocol first defined by Magesan et al. in [\"Scalable and Robust Benchmarking of Quantum Processes\"](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.180504). Other RB variants exist, however, and there are often good reasons to use them, particularly for multi-qubit benchmarking. One of these alternatives, [\"Direct RB\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07975), is detailed in its own tutorial (17 Direct Randomized Benchmarking).\n",

    "#### Essential parameters\n",
    "To sample a Clifford RB experiment, it is necessary to specify:\n",
    "- The RB sequence lengths\n",
    "- The number of circuits to sample at each length\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"Clifford RB length\" ($m$) is, within an additive constant, the length of the *uncompiled* Clifford circuit (the number of random $n$-qubit Clifford gates in the circuit). There are two possible conventions for the additive constant. \n",
    "1. The literature convention is that $m$ corresponds to the number of *independent, uniformly random* Clifford gates in the uncompiled circuit. So this corresponds to the total number of Clifford gates in the uncompiled circuit *minus 1* (the inversion Clifford gate is uniquely defined by the preceeding sequence, and so is not independent). Under this convention, $m$ can be an integer $\\geq 1$. \n",
    "2. The convention used by `pyGSTi` is that $m$ corresponds to the number of Clifford gates in the uncompiled circuit *minus 2*. This choice is motivated by the original Clifford RB protocol, which demands that the circuits being used have at least two gates (a circuit consisting only of state prep and measurement is not normally permitted in Clifford RB). Under this convention, $m$ can be any integer $\\geq 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use this second convention consistently across *all* RB circuit generating methods within `pyGSTi`.  Data *analysis*, however, is largely indepenent of which convention is used for the circuit generation. Recall that RB data is fit to the function $P_m = A + Bp^m$.  Rescaling the length, $m$, by an additive constant will only change the value of $B$ in the optimal fit (scaling it by factors of $p$). Importantly, the optimal fit of $p$, which fixes the error rate, remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we'll fix the Clifford RB lengths to $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\\}$ and take the number of circuits at each length to be $k = 10$."

If this list is not specified then the RB circuits returned will cover all qubits, providing a set of experiments capable of holistically benchmarking the entire device.\n",
