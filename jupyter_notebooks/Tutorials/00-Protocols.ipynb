    "# Running QCVV Protocols\n",
    "The main purpose of pyGSTi is to implement QCVV techniques that analyze some, often specific, experimental data to learn about a quantum processor.  Each such technique is called a \"protocol\" in pyGSTi, and this term roughly corresponds to its use in the literature.  To run a protocol on some data in pyGSTi, here's the general workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an `ExperimentDesign` object.  An \"experiment design\" is just a description of a set of experiments.  It tells you **what circuits you need to run on your quantum processor**.  Most protocols require a certain structure to their circuits, or knowledge that their circuits have been drawn from a certain distribution, and thus have a corresponding experiment design type suited to them, e.g. `StandardGSTDesign` and `CliffordRBDesign`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run or simulate the circuits demanded by the experiment design, and package the resulting data counts with the experiment design in a `ProtocolData` object.  This object constitutes the input to a protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a `Protocol` object, usually corresponding to the type of experiment design, and pass your data object to its `run()` method.  The result is a `ProtocolResults` object containing the results of running the protocol along with all the inputs that went in to generating those results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Look at the results object.  It can be used to make plots, generate reports, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of how to run some of the protocols within pyGSTi.  You'll notice how, for the most part, they follow the same pattern given above.  Here's a list of the protocols for easy reference:\n",

    "## Gate set tomography\n",
    "The most common reason to use pyGSTi is to run gate set tomography (GST).  The GST protocol uses sets of periodic circuits to probe, to a precision *linear* in the maximum-circuit length (i.e. depth), the gates on one or more of the qubits in a quantum processor.  For common gate sets with \"model packs\" that are built into pyGSTi, you only need to specify the maximum circuit length to construct an experiment design for GST.  In the example below, data is then simulated using a model with simple depolarizing errors.  The standard GST protocol is then run to produce a results object and then generate a report.   To learn more about GST, see the [GST Overview](algorithms/GST-Overview.ipynb) and [GST Protocols](algorithms/GST-Protocols.ipynb) tutorials."

The results from running the protocol are then used to create a plot of the RB decay curve along with the data.  For more information, see the [RB Overview tutorial](algorithms/RB-Overview.ipynb)."
