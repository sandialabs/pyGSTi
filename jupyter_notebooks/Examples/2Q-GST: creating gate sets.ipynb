    "# Creating a 2-qubit gate set with a custom 2-qubit gate\n",
    "While pyGSTi is able to support several common types of 2-qubit gates, the space of all possible 2-qubit gates is so large that some users will need to construct their own particular 2-qubit gate \"from scratch\".  In this example, we look at how to construct a 2-qubit gateset manually.  We'll use `pygsti.construction.build_gateset` to construct the single-qubit gates and we'll create a \"non-standard\" 2-qubit gate by specifying the unitary operation it performs as a $4\\times 4$ matrix. \n",
