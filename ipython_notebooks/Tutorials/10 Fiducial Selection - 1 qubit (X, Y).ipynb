    "To motivate fiducial selection, consider the following passage from quant-ph:1605.07674:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The purpose of the fiducials is to prepare a sufficiently diverse set of input states, and a sufficiently diverse set of measurements, to completely probe the operation of interest.  This is achieved if (and only if) the input states $\\{\\rho_i\\}\\equiv  \\{F_i|\\rho\\rangle\\rangle\\}$ and the measurement effects $\\{E_j\\} \\equiv \\{\\langle\\langle E|F_j\\}$ are both *informationally complete* (IC).  A set of matrices is IC if and only if it spans the vector space $\\mathcal{B}(H)$ of matrices.  This requires at least $d^2$ linearly independent elements.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In general, any randomly chosen set of $d^2$ states or effects will be IC.  So, for single-qubit GST, we could choose $d^2=4$ random fiducial sequences.  However, while the resulting $\\{\\rho_i\\}$ and $\\{E_j\\}$ will almost certainly be linearly independent, they may be *close* to linearly dependent.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We determine how linearly independent a fiducial set is in the following manner:  \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a set of fiducials $\\{F_i\\}_{i=1}^k$, we start by forming a matrix $M$, which will allow us to quantify how linearly independent the resulting $\\{\\rho_i\\}$ or $\\{E_j\\}$ will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are evaluating a set of preparation fiducials, then the i^th column of $M$ is $F_i|\\rho\\rangle\\rangle$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While we assume that there is only one preparation state $|\\rho\\rangle\\rangle$, there may be multiple measurement effects (e.g., if we're dealing with a two-qubit system).  When dealing with a collection of measurement effects $\\{E_j\\}$, the rows of $M$ are $\\langle\\langle E_j|F_i$ (see algorithms.fiducialselection.make_meas_mxs for full indexing explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then form the square matrix $MM^T$.  We either then score the fiducial set as the number of fiducials times the sum of the reciprocals of the singular values of $MM^T$ (kwarg scoreFunc = 'all') or by the number of fiducials times the reciprocal of the smallest singular value of $MM^T$ (kwarg scoreFunc = 'worst').  In both cases, a lower score is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the former case, we are attempting to make all the fiducials as uniformly informationally complete as possible, that is, we are trying to make our fiducial set as sensitive as possible to all directions in Hilbert-Schmidt space.  In the latter case, we are instead attempting minimize our insensitivity to the direction in Hilbert-Schmidt space that we are least sensitive to.\n"

    "2.  Generate a collection of sets of candidate fiducials, all of the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 2 we exhaustively check all fiducial sets.  For case 1, exhaustive search would typically be prohibitively expensive.  Therefore, we use an integer program that starts by checking a single case, and then comparing it to \"adjacent\" fiducial sets (ones that are the same as the first, save for the addition or omission of a single fiducial).  The integer program starts by essentially being a greedy algorithm that just tries iteratively in this fashion to find a fiducial set that has the best (lowest) score.  However, it is easy to get stuck in a bad local minimum.  Therefore, once a local minimum is found, we change our search method.  First, we only allow fiducials sets that are smaller than the one at the local minimum.  This is to expedite the process.  Additionally, we relax our score-checking constraints, allowing the optimizer to \"tunnel\" out of the local minimum.  This relaxation is quantified via either the `fixedSlack` or `slackFrac` parameter, explained below."
