#     """
#     Creates a circuit by randomply placing 2-qubit gates on qubit pairs.

#     Samples a random circuit layer by pairing up qubits and picking a two-qubit gate for a pair
#     with the specificed probability. This sampler *assumes* all-to-all connectivity, and does
#     not check that this condition is satisfied (more generally, it assumes that all gates can be
#     applied in parallel in any combination that would be well-defined).

#     The sampler works as follows: If there are an odd number of qubits, one qubit is chosen at
#     random to have a uniformly random 1-qubit gate applied to it (from all possible 1-qubit gates,
#     or those in `one_q_gate_names` if not None). Then, the remaining qubits are paired up, uniformly
#     at random. A uniformly random 2-qubit gate is then chosen for a pair with probability `two_q_prob`
#     (from all possible 2-qubit gates, or those in `two_q_gate_names` if not None). If a 2-qubit gate
#     is not chosen to act on a pair, then each qubit is independently and uniformly randomly assigned
#     a 1-qubit gate.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
#         The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit layer is being sampled for. This
#         function assumes all-to-all connectivity, but does not check this is satisfied. Unless
#         `qubit_labels` is not None, a circuit layer is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

#     qubit_labels : list, optional
#         If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit layer for. This is a subset of
#         `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit layer is sampled to acton all the qubits
#         in `pspec`.

#     two_q_prob : float, optional
#         A probability for a two-qubit gate to be applied to a pair of qubits. So, the expected
#         number of 2-qubit gates in the sampled layer is two_q_prob*floor(n/2).

#     one_q_gate_names : 'all' or list, optional
#         If not 'all', a list of the names of the 1-qubit gates to be sampled from when applying
#         a 1-qubit gate to a qubit. If this is 'all', the full set of 1-qubit gate names is extracted
#         from the QubitProcessorSpec.

#     two_q_gate_names : 'all' or list, optional
#         If not 'all', a list of the names of the 2-qubit gates to be sampled from when applying
#         a 2-qubit gate to a pair of qubits. If this is 'all', the full set of 2-qubit gate names is
#         extracted from the QubitProcessorSpec.

#     modelname : str, optional
#         Only used if one_q_gate_names or two_q_gate_names is None. Specifies which of the
#         `pspec.models` to use to extract the gate-set. The `clifford` default is suitable
#         for Clifford or direct RB, but will not use any non-Clifford gates in the gate-set.

#     rand_state: RandomState, optional
#         A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

#     Returns
#     -------
#     list of Labels
#         A list of gate Labels that defines a "complete" circuit layer (there is one and only

    in a layer depends on both the specified 2-qubit gate probability and the exact
    connectivity graph.

    This sampler is the following algorithm: List all the qubits, and repeat the
    following steps until all qubits are deleted from this list. 1) Uniformly at random
    pick a qubit from the list, and delete it from the list 2) Flip a coin with  bias
    `two_q_prob` to be "Heads". 3) If "Heads" then -- if there is one or more 2-qubit gates
    from this qubit to other qubits still in the list -- pick one of these at random.
    4) If we haven't chosen a 2-qubit gate for this qubit ("Tails" or "Heads" but there
    are no possible 2-qubit gates) then pick a uniformly random 1-qubit gate to apply to
    this qubit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit layer is being sampled for. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, a circuit layer is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit layer for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit layer is sampled to acton all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    two_q_prob : float, optional
        If a 2-qubit can is still possible on a qubit at that stage of the sampling, this is
        the probability a 2-qubit gate is chosen for that qubit. The expected number of
        2-qubit gates per layer depend on this quantity and the connectivity graph of
        the device.

        A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

    """
    Samples a random circuit layer using the specified list of "compatible two-qubit gates" (co2_q_gates).

    That is, the user inputs a list (`co2_q_gates`) specifying 2-qubit gates that are
    "compatible" -- meaning that they can be implemented simulatenously -- and a distribution
    over the different compatible sets, and a layer is sampled from this via:

    1. Pick a set of compatible two-qubit gates from the list `co2_q_gates`, according to the
    distribution specified by `co2_q_gates_prob`.
    2. For each 2-qubit gate in the chosen set of compatible gates, with probability `two_q_prob`
    add this gate to the layer.
    3. Uniformly sample 1-qubit gates for any qubits that don't yet have a gate on them,
    from those 1-qubit gates specified by `one_q_gate_names`.

    For example, consider 4 qubits with linear connectivity. a valid `co2_q_gates` list is
    `co2_q_gates = [[,],[Label(Gcphase,(0,1)),Label(Gcphase,(2,3))]]` which consists of an
    element containing zero 2-qubit gates and an element containing  two 2-qubit gates
    that can be applied in parallel. In this example there are 5 possible sets of compatible
    2-qubit gates:

    1. [,] (zero 2-qubit gates)
    2. [Label(Gcphase,(0,1)),] (one of the three 2-qubit gate)
    3. [Label(Gcphase,(1,2)),] (one of the three 2-qubit gate)
    4. [Label(Gcphase,(2,3)),] (one of the three 2-qubit gate)
    5. [Label(Gcphase,(0,1)), Label(Gcphase,(2,3)),] (the only compatible pair of 2-qubit gates).

    The list of compatible two-qubit gates `co2_q_gates` can be any list containing anywhere
    from 1 to all 5 of these lists.

    In order to allow for convenient sampling of some commonly useful distributions, 
    `co2_q_gates` can be a list of lists of lists of compatible 2-qubit gates ("nested" sampling). 
    In this case, a list of lists of compatible 2-qubit gates is picked according to the distribution 
    `co2_q_gates_prob`, and then one of the sublists of compatible 2-qubit gates in the selected list is 
    then chosen uniformly at random. For example, this is useful for sampling a layer containing one 
    uniformly random 2-qubit gate with probability p and a layer of 1-qubit gates with probability 
    1-p. Here, we can specify `co2_q_gates` as `[[],[[the 1st 2Q-gate,],[the 2nd 2Q-gate,], ...]]` and 
    set `two_q_prob=1` and `co2_q_gates_prob  = [1-p,p]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit layer is being sampled for. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, a circuit layer is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    qubit_labels : list
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit layer for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit layer is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    co2_q_gates : list
        This is either:

            1. A list of lists of 2-qubit gate Labels that can be applied in parallel.
            2. A list of lists of lists of 2-qubit gate Labels that can be applied in parallel.

        In case (1) each list in `co2_q_gates` should contain 2-qubit gates, in the form of Labels,
        that can be applied in parallel and act only on the qubits in `pspec` if `qubit_labels` is None,
        or act only on the qubits in  `qubit_labels` if `qubit_labels` is not None.  The sampler then picks
        one of these compatible sets of gates (with probability specified by `co2_q_gates_prob`, and converts
        this into a circuit layer by applying the 2-qubit gates it contains with the user-specified
        probability `two_q_prob`, and augmenting these 2-qubit gates with 1-qubit gates on all other qubits.

        In case (2) a sublist of lists is sampled from `co2_q_gates` according to `co2_q_gates_prob` and then we
        proceed as in case (1) but as though `co2_q_gates_prob` is the uniform distribution.

    co2_q_gates_prob : str or list of floats
        If a list, they are unnormalized probabilities to sample each of the elements of `co2_q_gates`. So it
        is a list of non-negative floats of the same length as `co2_q_gates`. If 'uniform', then the uniform
        distribution is used.

    two_q_prob : float, optional
        The probability for each two-qubit gate to be applied to a pair of qubits, after a
        set of compatible 2-qubit gates has been chosen. The expected number of 2-qubit
        gates in a layer is `two_q_prob` times the expected number of 2-qubit gates in a
        set of compatible 2-qubit gates sampled according to `co2_q_gates_prob`.

    one_q_gate_names : 'all' or list of strs, optional
        If not 'all', a list of the names of the 1-qubit gates to be sampled from when applying
        a 1-qubit gate to a qubit. If this is 'all', the full set of 1-qubit gate names is
        extracted from the QubitProcessorSpec.

    rand_state: RandomState, optional
        A np.random.RandomState object for seeding RNG

    Returns
    -------
    list of gates
        A list of gate Labels that defines a "complete" circuit layer (there is one and
        only one gate acting on each qubit).

    """
    Samples a random circuit of the specified length (or ~ twice this length).

    The created circuit's layers are independently sampled according to the specified
    sampling distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for. This is always
        handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function. Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    length : int
        If `addlocal` is False, this is the length of the sampled circuit. If `addlocal is
        True the length of the circuits is 2*length+1 with odd-indexed layers sampled according
        to the sampler specified by `sampler`, and the the zeroth layer + the even-indexed
        layers consisting of random 1-qubit gates (with the sampling specified by `lsargs`)

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'edgegrab'', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates. If this is a
        function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and
        returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that the default
        'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the only
        sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler. For some in-built samplers this is not
        optional.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        If False, the circuit sampled is of length `length` and each layer is independently
        sampled according to the sampler specified by `sampler`. If True, the circuit sampled
        is of length 2*`length`+1 where: the zeroth + all even layers are consisting of
        independently random 1-qubit gates (with the sampling specified by `lsargs`); the
        odd-indexed layers are independently sampled according to `sampler`. So `length`+1
        layers consist only of 1-qubit gates, and `length` layers are sampled according to
        `sampler`.

    lsargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the 1-qubit gate layers sampler
        rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates for the alternating 1-qubit-only layers that are
        included in the circuit if `addlocal` is True. This argument is not used if `addlocal`

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
#         The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
#         "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned circuit will be over
#         the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
#         is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
#         of importance when not using an in-built sampler).

#         The length of the circuit. Todo: update for varying length in different subsets.

#     structure : str or tuple, optional
#         todo.

#         If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
#         Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
#         in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
#         corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates.
#         If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
#         QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
#         the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is
#         the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
#         connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

#     samplerargs : list, optional
#         A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
#         The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
#         and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
#         optional for some choices of `sampler`.

#     addlocal : bool, optional
#         Whether to follow each layer in the circuit, sampled according to `sampler` with
#         a layer of 1-qubit gates. If this is True then the length of the circuit is double
#         the requested length.

#     ----------
#     pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
#         The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
#         "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned circuit will be over
#         the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
#         is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
#         of importance when not using an in-built sampler).

#     circuits_per_subset : <TODO typ>
#         <TODO description>

#     structure : str or tuple.
#         Defines the "structure" of the simultaneous circuit. TODO : more details.

#     sampler : str or function, optional
#         If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
#         Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
#         in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
#         corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates.
#         If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
#         QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
#         the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the
#         only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
#         connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

#     samplerargs : list, optional
#         A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
#         The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
#         and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
#         optional for some choices of `sampler`.

#     descriptor : str, optional
#         A description of the experiment being generated. Stored in the output dictionary.

    """
    Generates a "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) circuit.

    DRB is the protocol introduced in arXiv:1807.07975 (2018). The length of the "core" circuit is
    given by `length` and may be any integer >= 0. An n-qubit DRB circuit consists of (1) a circuit
    the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state; (2) a length-l circuit (specified by `length`)
    consisting of circuit layers sampled according to some user-specified distribution (specified by
    `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of the preceeding circuit to a computational
    basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
        is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
        of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
        `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    clifford_compilation : CompilationRules
        Rules for compiling the "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

    length : int
        The "direct RB length" of the circuit, which is closely related to the circuit depth. It
        must be an integer >= 0. Unless `addlocal` is True, it is the depth of the "core" random
        circuit, sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
        each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
        1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
        layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is
        the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuit, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuit (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. If True, the ideal output of the circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
        This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
        Wether to begin the circuit with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
        standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
        to have this set to True.

    conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
        DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
        a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
        step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
        unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
        However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
        of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
        if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
        to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
        implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
        algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated
        in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
        compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
        qubits as possible.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
        compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
        arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
        purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
        in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

    partitioned : bool, optional
        If False, a single circuit is returned consisting of the full circuit. If True, three circuits
        are returned in a list consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit or list of Circuits
        If partioned is False, a random DRB circuit sampled as specified. If partioned is True, a list of
        three circuits consisting of (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1) [except in the case of cliffordtwirl=False, when it is a list of two circuits].
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

#     Generates a simultaneous "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) circuit.

#     DRB is the protocol introduced in arXiv:1807.07975 (2018). An n-qubit DRB circuit consists of
#     (1) a circuit the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state; (2) a length-l circuit
#     (specified by `length`) consisting of circuit layers sampled according to some user-specified
#     distribution (specified by `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of the preceeding
#     circuit to a computational basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further details. Todo :
#     what SDRB is.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
#         The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
#         "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
#         the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
#         is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
#         of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
#         `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

#     clifford_compilations : dict
#         A dictionary with the potential keys `'absolute'` and `'paulieq'` and corresponding
#         :class:`CompilationRules` values.  These compilation rules specify how to compile the
#         "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

#     length : int
#         The "direct RB length" of the circuit, which is closely related to the circuit depth. It
#         must be an integer >= 0. Unless `addlocal` is True, it is the depth of the "core" random
#         circuit, sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
#         each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
#         1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
#         layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

#     structure : str or tuple, optional
#         todo.

#     sampler : str or function, optional
#         If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
#         Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
#         in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
#         corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
#         a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
#         If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
#         QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
#         the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is
#         the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
#         connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

#     samplerargs : list, optional
#         A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
#         The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
#         and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
#         optional for some choices of `sampler`.

#     addlocal : bool, optional
#         Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuit, sampled according to `sampler` with
#         a layer of 1-qubit gates.

#     lsargs : list, optional
#         Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
#         layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

#     randomizeout : bool, optional
#         If False, the ideal output of the circuit (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
#         bit string. If True, the ideal output of the circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
#         This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

#     cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
#         Wether to begin the circuit with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
#         standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
#         to have this set to True.

#     conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
#         DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
#         a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
#         step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
#         unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
#         However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
#         of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
#         if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
#         to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
#         implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

#     citerations : int, optional
#         Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
#         algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated
#         in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
#         generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
#         compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
#         qubits as possible.

#     compilerargs : list, optional
#         A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
#         compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
#         arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
#         purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
#         in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

#     partitioned : bool, optional
#         If False, a single circuit is returned consisting of the full circuit. If True, three circuits
#         are returned in a list consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
#         (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
#         and then (3) to (1).

#     seed: int, optional
#         Seed for RNG

#     Returns
#     -------
#     Circuit or list of Circuits
#         If partioned is False, a random DRB circuit sampled as specified. If partioned is True, a list of
#         three circuits consisting of (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
#         (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
#         and then (3) to (1) [except in the case of cliffordtwirl=False, when it is a list of two circuits].
#     Tuple
#         A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
#         circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
#         corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
#         `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
#         In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
#         qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

#     Generates a simultaneous "direct randomized benchmarking" (DRB) experiments (circuits).

#     DRB is the protocol introduced in arXiv:1807.07975 (2018).
#     An n-qubit DRB circuit consists of (1) a circuit the prepares a uniformly random stabilizer state;
#     (2) a length-l circuit (specified by `length`) consisting of circuit layers sampled according to
#     some user-specified distribution (specified by `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of
#     the preceeding circuit to a computational basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further
#     details. In simultaneous DRB ...... <TODO more description>.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
#         The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
#         "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
#         the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
#         is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
#         of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
#         `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

#     depths : int
#         The set of "direct RB depths" for the circuits. The DRB depths must be integers >= 0.
#         Unless `addlocal` is True, the DRB length is the depth of the "core" random circuit,
#         sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
#         each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
#         1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
#         layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

#     circuits_per_length : int
#         The number of (possibly) different DRB circuits sampled at each length.

#     structure : str or tuple.
#         Defines the "structure" of the simultaneous DRB experiment. TODO : more details.

#     sampler : str or function, optional
#         If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
#         Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
#         in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
#         corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
#         a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
#         If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
#         QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
#         the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the
#         only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
#         connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

#     samplerargs : list, optional
#         A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
#         The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
#         and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
#         optional for some choices of `sampler`.

#     addlocal : bool, optional
#         Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
#         a layer of 1-qubit gates.

#     lsargs : list, optional
#         Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
#         layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

#     randomizeout : bool, optional
#         If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
#         bit string. If True, the ideal output of each circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
#         This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

#     cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
#         Wether to begin the circuit with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
#         standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
#         to have this set to True.

#     conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
#         DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
#         a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
#         step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
#         unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
#         However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
#         of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
#         if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
#         to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
#         implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

#     citerations : int, optional
#         Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
#         algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuits generated
#         in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
#         generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
#         compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
#         qubits as possible.

#     compilerargs : list, optional
#         A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
#         compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
#         arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
#         purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
#         in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

#     partitioned : bool, optional
#         If False, each circuit is returned as a single full circuit. If True, each circuit is returned as
#         a list of three circuits consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
#         (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
#         and then (3) to (1).

#     set_isolated : bool, optional
#         Todo

#     setcomplement_isolated : bool, optional
#         Todo

#     descriptor : str, optional
#         A description of the experiment being generated. Stored in the output dictionary.

#     verbosity : int, optional
#         If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

#     seed: int, optional
#         Seed for RNG

#     Returns
#     -------
#     Circuit or list of Circuits
#         If partioned is False, a random DRB circuit sampled as specified. If partioned is True, a list of
#         three circuits consisting of (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
#         (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
#         and then (3) to (1).
#     Tuple
#         A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
#         circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
#         corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
#         `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
#         In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
#         qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.
#     dict
#         A dictionary containing the generated RB circuits, the error-free outputs of the circuit,
#         and the specification used to generate the circuits. The keys are:

#         - 'circuits'. A dictionary of the sampled circuits. The circuit with key(l,k) is the kth circuit
#         at DRB length l.

#         - 'idealout'. A dictionary of the error-free outputs of the circuits as tuples. The tuple with
#         key(l,k) is the error-free output of the (l,k) circuit. The ith element of this tuple corresponds
#         to the error-free outcome for the qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit and/or the ith element
#         of the list at the key 'qubitordering'. These tuples will all be (0,0,0,...) when `randomizeout` is
#         False

#         - 'qubitordering'. The ordering of the qubits in the 'idealout' tuples.

#         - 'spec'. A dictionary containing all of the parameters handed to this function, except `pspec`.
#         This then specifies how the circuits where generated.

    """Helper function to compile a random Clifford circuit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned CRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`.

    clifford_compilations : dict
        A dictionary with at least the potential keys `'absolute'` and `'paulieq'` and corresponding
        :class:`CompilationRules` values.  These compilation rules specify how to compile the
        "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates. Additional :class:`CompilationRules` can be
        provided, particularly for use with `exact_compilation_key`.

    qubit_labels : list
        A list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for.

    citerations : int
        Some of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default algorithm) are
        randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated in the
        iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a CRB circuit is linear in `citerations` * (`length` + 2). Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit
        gate count compilations of the Cliffords are important in order to successfully implement
        CRB on more qubits.

    compilerargs : list
        A list of arguments that are handed to compile_clifford() function, which includes all the
        optional arguments of compile_clifford() *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`).
        In order, this list should be values for:
        
        algorithm : str. A string that specifies the compilation algorithm. The default in
        compile_clifford() will always be whatever we consider to be the 'best' all-round
        algorithm
        
        aargs : list. A list of optional arguments for the particular compilation algorithm.
        
        costfunction : 'str' or function. The cost-function from which the "best" compilation
        for a Clifford is chosen from all `citerations` compilations. The default costs a
        circuit as 10x the num. of 2-qubit gates in the circuit + 1x the depth of the circuit.

    Generates a "Clifford randomized benchmarking" (CRB) circuit.

    CRB is the current-standard RB protocol defined in "Scalable and robust randomized benchmarking of quantum
    processes", Magesan et al. PRL 106 180504 (2011). This consists of a circuit of `length`+1 uniformly
    random n-qubit Clifford gates followed by the unique inversion Clifford, with all the Cliffords compiled
    into the "native" gates of a device as specified by `pspec`. The circuit output by this function will
    respect the connectivity of the device, as encoded into `pspec` (see the QubitProcessorSpec object docstring
    for how to construct the relevant `pspec`).

    Note the convention that the the output Circuit consists of `length+2` Clifford gates, rather than the
    more usual convention of defining the "CRB length" to be the number of Clifford gates - 1. This is for
    consistency with the other RB functions in pyGSTi: in all RB-circuit-generating functions in pyGSTi
    length zero corresponds to the minimum-length circuit allowed by the protocol. Note that changing the
    "RB depths" by a constant additive factor is irrelevant for fitting purposes (except that it changes
    the obtained "SPAM" fit parameter).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
        "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned CRB circuit will be over
        the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`.

    clifford_compilations : dict
        A dictionary with at least the potential keys `'absolute'` and `'paulieq'` and corresponding
        :class:`CompilationRules` values.  These compilation rules specify how to compile the
        "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates. Additional :class:`CompilationRules` can be
        provided, particularly for use with `exact_compilation_key`.

    length : int
        The "CRB length" of the circuit -- an integer >= 0 --  which is the number of Cliffords in the
        circuit - 2 *before* each Clifford is compiled into the native gate-set.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the "wires" in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant. If desired, a circuit that explicitly idles on the other qubits can be obtained
        by using methods of the Circuit object.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuit (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. This is probably considered to be the "standard" in CRB. If True, the ideal output
        of the circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string. This setting is useful for, e.g.,
        detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default algorithm) are
        randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated in the
        iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a CRB circuit is linear in `citerations` * (`length` + 2). Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit
        gate count compilations of the Cliffords are important in order to successfully implement
        CRB on more qubits.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to compile_clifford() function, which includes all the
        optional arguments of compile_clifford() *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`).
        In order, this list should be values for:
        
        algorithm : str. A string that specifies the compilation algorithm. The default in
        compile_clifford() will always be whatever we consider to be the 'best' all-round
        algorithm
        
        aargs : list. A list of optional arguments for the particular compilation algorithm.
        
        costfunction : 'str' or function. The cost-function from which the "best" compilation
        for a Clifford is chosen from all `citerations` compilations. The default costs a
        circuit as 10x the num. of 2-qubit gates in the circuit + 1x the depth of the circuit.
        
        prefixpaulis : bool. Whether to prefix or append the Paulis on each Clifford.
        
        paulirandomize : bool. Whether to follow each layer in the Clifford circuit with a
        random Pauli on each qubit (compiled into native gates). I.e., if this is True the
        native gates are Pauli-randomized. When True, this prevents any coherent errors adding
        (on average) inside the layers of each compiled Clifford, at the cost of increased
        circuit depth. Defaults to False.
        
        For more information on these options, see the `:func:compile_clifford()` docstring.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.
    
    return_native_gate_counts: bool, optional
        Whether to return the number of native gates in the first `length`+1 compiled Cliffords
    
    exact_compilation_key: str, optional
        The key into `clifford_compilations` to use for exact deterministic complation of Cliffords.
        The underlying :class:`CompilationRules` object must provide compilations for all possible
        n-qubit Cliffords that will be generated. This also requires the pspec is able to generate the
        symplectic representations for all n-qubit Cliffords in :meth:`compute_clifford_symplectic_reps`.
        This is currently generally intended for use out-of-the-box with 1-qubit Clifford RB;
        however, larger number of qubits can be used so long as the user specifies the processor spec and
        compilation rules properly.

    To implement mirror RB it is necessary for U^(-1) to in the gate-set for every U in the gate-set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for. The `pspec` is always
        handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function.

    absolute_compilation : CompilationRules
        Rules for exactly (absolutely) compiling the "native" gates of `pspec` into clifford gates.

    length : int
        The "mirror RB length" of the circuit, which is closely related to the circuit depth. It
        must be an even integer, and can be zero.

        If `localclifford` and `paulirandomize` are False, this is the depth of the sampled circuit.
        The first length/2 layers are all sampled independently according to the sampler specified by

        by the first half.

        If `paulirandomize` is True and `localclifford` is False, the depth of the circuits is
        2*length+1 with odd-indexed layers sampled according to the sampler specified by `sampler`, and
        the the zeroth layer + the even-indexed layers consisting of random 1-qubit Pauli gates.

        If `paulirandomize` and `localclifford` are True, the depth of the circuits is
        2*length+1 + X where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
        the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the "wires" in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid option for n-qubit MRB -- it results in sim. 1-qubit MRB -- but it is not explicitly
        forbidden by this function]. If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes
        as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate
        Label objects. Note that the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful
        in-built sampler, but it is the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec
        *and* works for arbitrary connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers
        for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.

    localclifford : bool, optional
        Whether to start the circuit with uniformly random 1-qubit Cliffords and all of the
        qubits (compiled into the native gates of the device).

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        Whether to have uniformly random Pauli operators on all of the qubits before and
        after all of the layers in the "out" and "back" random circuits. At length 0 there
        is a single layer of random Pauli operators (in between two layers of 1-qubit Clifford
        gates if `localclifford` is True); at length l there are 2l+1 Pauli layers as there
        are

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    Returns
    -------
    Circuit
        A random MRB circuit, sampled as specified, of depth:

        `length`, if not paulirandomize and not local clifford.
        
        2*`length`+1 if paulirandomize and not local clifford.
        
        `length` + X, if not paulirandomize and local clifford, where X is a random variable
        that accounts for the depth from the layers of random 1-qubit Cliffords (X = 2 if the 1
        qubit Clifford gates are "native" gates in the QubitProcessorSpec).
        
        2*`length`+1 + X, if paulirandomize and local clifford, where X is a random variable
        that accounts for the depth from the layers of random 1-qubit Cliffords (X = 2 if the 1
        qubit Clifford gates are "native" gates in the QubitProcessorSpec).
        
    Tuple
        A length-n tuple of integers in [0,1], corresponding to the error-free outcome of the
        circuit. Always all zeros if `randomizeout` is False. The ith element of the tuple
        corresponds to the error-free outcome for the qubit labelled by: the ith element of
        `qubit_labels`, if `qubit_labels` is not None; the ith element of `pspec.qubit_labels`, otherwise.
        In both cases, the ith element of the tuple corresponds to the error-free outcome for the
        qubit on the ith wire of the output circuit.

    """
    Generates a "binary randomized benchmarking" (BiRB) circuit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for. The `pspec` is always
        handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function.

    clifford_compilations : CompilationRules
        Rules for exactly (absolutely) compiling the "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

    length : int
        The "benchmark depth" of the circuit, which is the number of randomly sampled layers of gates in 
        the core circuit. The full BiRB circuit has depth=length+2. 

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.

    layer_sampling : str, optional
        Determines the structure of the randomly sampled layers of gates:
            1. 'mixed1q2q': Layers contain radomly-sampled two-qubit gates and randomly-sampled 
            single-qubit gates on all remaining qubits. 
            2. 'alternating1q2q': Each layer consists of radomly-sampled two-qubit gates, with 
            all other qubits idling, followed by randomly sampled single-qubit gates on all qubits. 

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid option for n-qubit BiRB, but it is not explicitly forbidden by this function]. 
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes
        as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate
        Label objects. Note that the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful
        in-built sampler, but it is the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec
        *and* works for arbitrary connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers
        for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

     addlocal : bool, optional
         Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
         a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.


    Returns
    -------
    Circuit
        A random BiRB circuit.
    String
        A length-n string of 'Z's and 'I's, which describes the target Pauli measurement for the BiRB circuit.
        The circuit, when run without errors, produces an eigenstate of the target Pauli operator.  
    Int (Either 1 or -1)
        Specifies the sign of the target Pauli measurement.

def random_alternating_clifford_circ(pspec, depth, qubit_labels=None, two_q_gate_density=0.25):
    """
    Generates a random circuit with composite layers cponsisting of a layer of two-qubit gates followed by 
    a layer of of single-qubit gates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
        The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for. The `pspec` is always
        handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function.

    depth : int
        The number of composite layers in the final circuit.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubFalseits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.


    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.


    Returns
