    Performs calculations with explicitly-represented objects.

    This class performs calculations with *simplified* objects (so don't
    need to worry abount POVMs or Instruments, just preps, ops, & effects),
    but, unlike forward simulators, these calculations require knowledge of *all*
    of the possible operations in each category (not just the ones in a given
    circuti).  As such, instances of `ExplicitOpModelCalc` are almost always
    associated with an instance of `ExplicitOpModel`.

        various operators act.

    simplified_ops : dict

    simplified_effects : dict

        ----------
        item_weights : dict, optional

            or SPAM operators, respectively.  Values are floating point numbers.
            These weights define the metric used to compute the non-gauge space,

        non_gauge_mix_mx : numpy array, optional
            An array of shape (n_non_gauge_params,n_gauge_params) specifying how to

        numpy array
            The projection operator as a N x N matrix, where N is the number
            of parameters (obtained via num_params()).  This projector acts on
            parameter-space, and has rank equal to the number of non-gauge

        #  at that point.  This tangent space is spanned by some basis (~16 elements for the 1Q case),
        #  which associate with the infinitesimal gauge transform ?generators? on the full space.
        #  The subspace of H spanned by the derivatives w.r.t gauge transformations at P (a Model) spans
        #  the gauge space, and the complement of this (in H) is the non-gauge space.
        #
        #  An element of the gauge group can be written gg = exp(-K), where K is a n x n matrix.  If K is
        #   hermitian then gg is unitary, but this need not be the case.  A gauge transform acts on a
        #   gatset via Model => gg^-1 G gg, i.e. G => exp(K) G exp(-K).  We care about the action of
        #   infinitesimal gauge tranformations (b/c the *derivative* vectors span the tangent space),
        #   which act as:
        #    G => (I+K) G (I-K) = G + [K,G] + ignored(K^2), where [K,G] := KG-GK
        #
        # To produce a projector onto the gauge-space, we compute the *column* vectors
        #  dG_ij = [K_ij,G], where K_ij is the i,j-th matrix unit (56x1 in the 1Q case, 16 such column vectors)
        #  and then form a projector in the standard way.
        #  (to project onto |v1>, |v2>, etc., form P = sum_i |v_i><v_i|)
        #
        #Typically nOpParams < len(dG_ij) and linear system is overconstrained
        #   and no solution is expected.  If no solution exists, simply ignore
        #
        # So we form P = sum_ij dG_ij * transpose(dG_ij) (56x56 in 1Q case)
        #              = dG * transpose(dG)              where dG_ij form the *columns* of dG (56x16 in 1Q case)
        # But dG_ij are not orthonormal, so really we need a slight modification,
        #  otherwise P'P' != P' as must be the case for a projector:
        #
        # P' = dG * (transpose(dG) * dG)^-1 * transpose(dG) (see wikipedia on projectors)
        #
        #    or equivalently (I think)
        #
        # P' = pseudo-inv(P)*P
        #
        #  since the pseudo-inv is defined by P*pseudo-inv(P) = I and so P'P' == P'
        #  and P' is our gauge-projector!

        # Note: In the general case of parameterized gates (i.e. non-fully parameterized gates), there are fewer
        #   gate parameters than the size of dG_ij ( < 56 in 1Q case).  In this general case, we want to know
        #   what (if any) change in gate parameters produces the change dG_ij of the operation matrix elements.
        #   That is, we solve dG_ij = derivWRTParams * dParams_ij for dParams_ij, where derivWRTParams is
        #   the derivative of the operation matrix elements with respect to the gate parameters (derivWRTParams
        #   is 56x(nOpParams) and dParams_ij is (nOpParams)x1 in the 1Q case) -- then substitute dG_ij
        #   with dParams_ij above to arrive at a (nOpParams)x(nOpParams) projector (compatible with
        #   hessian computed by model).
        #
        #   Actually, we want to know if what changes gate parameters
        #   produce changes in the span of all the dG_ij, so really we want the intersection of the space
        #   defined by the columns of derivWRTParams (the "gate-parameter range" space) and the dG_ij vectors.
        #
        #   This intersection is determined by nullspace( derivWRTParams | dG ), where the pipe denotes
        #     concatenating the matrices together.  Then, if x is a basis vector of the nullspace
        #     x[0:nOpParams] is the basis vector for the intersection space within the gate parameter space,
        #     that is, the analogue of dParams_ij in the single-dG_ij introduction above.
        #
        #   Still, we just substitue these dParams_ij vectors (as many as the nullspace dimension) for dG_ij
        #   above to get the general case projector.
