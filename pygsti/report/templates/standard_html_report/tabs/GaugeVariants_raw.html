<h1>Raw Estimates</h1>
<p>This tab shows the raw GST estimates &mdash; the density matrices, POVM effects, and process matrices that comprise the estimated gateset.  These are explicitly gauge-dependent, and most reports include multiple <q>gauge optimizations</q> that correspond to slightly different (but physically equivalent and indistinguishable) representations  of the operations.  Usually, these raw estimates are less useful than the derived properties and decompositions shown elsewhere, but sometimes it's useful to see them.  Furthermore, it's possible (at least in some versions of the report) to download the raw gateset in machine-readable form, in order to do calculations and simulations with it.</p>

	<figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Estimated SPAM operations</span> <span class="captiondetail">This table presents the GST-estimated SPAM operations &mdash; the initial state, as a density matrix in the computational basis, and the terminating measurement's POVM effects in the computational basis &mdash; and compares them to the corresponding ideal target operations.  All of these matrices should be positive semidefinite, so their eigenvalues are shown to provide a quick diagnostic. The final column represents the states and measurement effects in terms of their representations as vectors in Hilber-Schmidt space, with the specified basis.</span></figcaption>

	<figcaption><span class="captiontitle">Estimated logic gate operations</span> <span class="captiondetail">This table presents the GST-estimated logic gates &mdash; represented as process matrices (aka Liouville superoperators or Pauli transfer matrices) &mdash; and compares them to the <em>ideal</em> (generally unitary) <q>target</q> logic gates.  Each gate is represented as a <span class="math">d^2\times d^2</span> <em>superoperator</em> that acts by matrix multiplication on vectors in the vector space <span class="math">\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})</span> of operators.  Matrices are displayed using a heat map that ranges between 1.0 (<span style="color:red">red</span>) and -1.0 (<span style="color:blue">blue</span>), and hovering the pointer over a matrix element will pop up its precise numerical value.  Note that it is impossible to discern even order-1%% deviations from the ideal in this view; that's what other analyses (especially the Gate Error Generators tab) are for.</span></figcaption>
