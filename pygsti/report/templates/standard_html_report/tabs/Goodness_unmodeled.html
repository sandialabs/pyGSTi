<h1>Model Violation Analysis: quantifying un-modeled error</h1>
<p>GST datasets are often <em>very</em> inconsistent with the Markovian gateset model.  This is relatively unsurprising, and means only that real qubits often drift or experience other forms of noise that aren't stationary and Markovian.  A standard way of measuring the amount of this model violation is to express the degree to which we would expect the model to generate the observed data, given as a number of standard deviations (<span class="math">N_\sigma</span>) or p-value.  Large <span class="math">N_\sigma</span> or small p-value indicate high certainty that the model is incorrect (violated) but do not express how much would need to be done to "fix" the model.  In this tab, we attempt to quantify the un-modeled error by allowing an amount of slack, measured in total variational distance (TVD) in the probabilities predicted by the model.  With enough slack the model will be able to predict, and therefore "fit" any data; we answer the question "What is the minimum amount of slack needed to predict the data?", and allocate slack on a per-gate basis. (TODO: MORE DESCRIPTION)</p>

<p>If the estimate currently selected on the sidebar used this technique (often denoted by a <q>.wildcard</q> suffix), then this tab shows several important quantities.  Before describing these, however, it is important to note that <b>all of the other model violation tabs</b> (and relevant figures in the <q>Summary</q> tab) <b>show you the model violation <em>without</em> allowing any slack in the predicted probabilities.  <em>This tab</em> shows the model violation <em>with</em> the TVD slack described (WHERE?)</b>, and so, by construction, the fit metrics shown here should always look pretty good.  The first several figures replicate those of the other model violation tabs (except they allow for slack in the probabilities!), and the final table shows how much TVD slack was allowed per gate.  When a figure shows up as <q>N/A</q> then it means that the currently-selected estimate has not had any slack applied to it at all, and so there's nothing to show.</p>

This wildcard is assigned according to a model in which we allocate it among each gate proportionately to that gate's diamond distance. This gives a sense of the ratio of error in each gate between Markovian and non-Markovian sources.</span></figcaption>

Each subset of the data, defined by its maximum sequence length <span class="math">L</span>, yields an independent fit that is analyzed here.  The key quantity is the difference between the observed and expected maximum loglikelihood (<span class="math">\log(\mathcal{L})</span>).  If the model fits, then <span class="math">2\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})</span> should be a <span class="math">\chi^2_k</span> random variable, where <span class="math">k</span> (the degrees of freedom) is the difference between <span class="math">N_S</span> (the number of independent data points) and <span class="math">N_p</span> (the number of model parameters).
