<h1>Idle Tomography</h1>

<p>This tab tells you about Idle Tomography results.  Idle tomography is a lightweight form of tomography that characterizes small, low-weight errors on an idle gate (one that is supposed to perform the identity operation).  This tab is a work in progress, and is apt to change significantly in the future.</p>
