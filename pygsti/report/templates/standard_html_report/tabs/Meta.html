<h1>System and pyGSTi parameters</h1>
<p>This tab contains a raw dump of system information and various pyGSTi parameters.  Its purpose is to stamp this report with parameters that indicate how exactly GST was run to create it, as well as to record the software environment in within which the report creation was run.  However, if the core GST computation was done on a different computer, then the software information contained here will be less useful (it describes the environment in which the report was generated, not the one in which the estimate was generated).</p>
