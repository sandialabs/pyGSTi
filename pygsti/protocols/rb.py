class CliffordRBDesign(_vb.BenchmarkingDesign):
    """
    Experiment design for Clifford randomized benchmarking.

    This encapsulates a "Clifford randomized benchmarking" (CRB) experiment. CRB is the RB protocol defined 
    in "Scalable and robust randomized benchmarking of quantum processes", Magesan et al. PRL 106 180504 (2011).
    The circuits created by this function will respect the connectivity and gate-set of the device encoded by 
    `pspec` (see the :class:`QubitProcessorSpec` object docstring for how to construct the relevant `pspec` 
    for a device).

    Note that this function uses the convention that a depth "l" CRB circuit  consists of "l"+2 Clifford gates 
    before compilation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the CRB experiment is being generated for, which defines the 
       "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned CRB circuits will be over the gates in 
       `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`.

    clifford_compilations : dict
        A dictionary with the potential keys `'absolute'` and `'paulieq'` and corresponding class:`CompilationRules` values. 
        These compilation rules specify how to compile the "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

    depths : list of ints
        The "CRB depths" of the circuit; a list of integers >= 0. The CRB length is the number of Cliffords in the 
        circuit - 2 *before* each Clifford is compiled into the native gate-set.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different CRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuits are to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the "wires" in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant. If desired, a circuit that explicitly idles on the other qubits can be obtained
        by using methods of the Circuit object.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is always
        the all-zeros bit string. This is probably considered to be the "standard" in CRB. If True,
        the ideal output a circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string. This setting is
        useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    interleaved_circuit : Circuit, optional (default None)
        Circuit to use in the constuction of an interleaved CRB experiment. When specified each
        random clifford operation is interleaved with the specified circuit.

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default algorithm) are
        randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated in the
        iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a CRB circuit is linear in `citerations * (CRB length + 2)`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit
        gate count compilations of the Cliffords are important in order to successfully implement
        CRB on more qubits.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to compile_clifford() function, which includes all the
        optional arguments of compile_clifford() *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`).
        In order, this list should be values for:
        
        * algorithm : str. A string that specifies the compilation algorithm. The default in
          compile_clifford() will always be whatever we consider to be the 'best' all-round
          algorithm.
        * aargs : list. A list of optional arguments for the particular compilation algorithm.
        * costfunction : 'str' or function. The cost-function from which the "best" compilation
          for a Clifford is chosen from all `citerations` compilations. The default costs a
          circuit as 10x the num. of 2-qubit gates in the circuit + 1x the depth of the circuit.
        * prefixpaulis : bool. Whether to prefix or append the Paulis on each Clifford.
        * paulirandomize : bool. Whether to follow each layer in the Clifford circuit with a
          random Pauli on each qubit (compiled into native gates). I.e., if this is True the
          native gates are Pauli-randomized. When True, this prevents any coherent errors adding
          (on average) inside the layers of each compiled Clifford, at the cost of increased
          circuit depth. Defaults to False.
        
        For more information on these options, see the compile_clifford() docstring.

    descriptor : str, optional
        A string describing the experiment generated, which will be stored in the returned
        dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

        Create a :class:`CliffordRBDesign` from an existing set of sampled RB circuits.

        This function serves as an alternative to the usual method of creating a Clifford

        takes a list of previously-sampled random circuits and does not sampling internally.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_by_depth : dict
            A dictionary whose keys are integer depths and whose values are lists of
            `(circuit, ideal_outcome, num_native_gates)` tuples giving each RB circuit, its 
            ideal (correct) outcome, and (optionally) the number of native gates in the compiled Cliffords.

            iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to

    (2) a length-l circuit (specified by `length`) consisting of circuit layers sampled according to
    some user-specified distribution (specified by `sampler`), (3) a circuit that maps the output of
    the preceeding circuit to a computational basis state. See arXiv:1807.07975 (2018) for further
    details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the circuit is being sampled for, which defines the
       "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned DRB circuit will be over
       the gates in `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`. Note that `pspec`
       is always handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function (this is only
       of importance when not using an in-built sampler for the "core" of the DRB circuit). Unless
       `qubit_labels` is not None, the circuit is sampled over all the qubits in `pspec`.

    clifford_compilations : dict
        A dictionary with the potential keys `'absolute'` and `'paulieq'` and corresponding
        :class:`CompilationRules` values.  These compilation rules specify how to compile the
        "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

    depths : int
        The set of "direct RB depths" for the circuits. The DRB depths must be integers >= 0.
        Unless `addlocal` is True, the DRB length is the depth of the "core" random circuit,
        sampled according to `sampler`, specified in step (2) above. If `addlocal` is True,
        each layer in the "core" circuit sampled according to "sampler` is followed by a layer of
        1-qubit gates, with sampling specified by `lsargs` (and the first layer is proceeded by a
        layer of 1-qubit gates), and so the circuit of step (2) is length 2*`length` + 1.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different DRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
        `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
        in `pspec`.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'edgegrab', pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named `circuit_layer_by_*` (with `*` replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid form of sampling for n-qubit DRB, but is not explicitly forbidden in this function].
        If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes as the first argument a
        QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate Label objects. Note that
        the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful in-built sampler, but it is the
        only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec *and* works for arbitrary
        connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
        and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
        optional for some choices of `sampler`.

    addlocal : bool, optional
        Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
        a layer of 1-qubit gates.

    lsargs : list, optional
        Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
        layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
        bit string. If True, the ideal output of each circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
        This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
        Wether to begin the circuits with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
        standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
        to have this set to True.

    conditionaltwirl : bool, optional
        DRB only requires that the initial/final sequences of step (1) and (3) create/measure
        a uniformly random / particular stabilizer state, rather than implement a particular unitary.
        step (1) and (3) can be achieved by implementing a uniformly random Clifford gate and the
        unique inversion Clifford, respectively. This is implemented if `conditionaltwirl` is False.
        However, steps (1) and (3) can be implemented much more efficiently than this: the sequences
        of (1) and (3) only need to map a particular input state to a particular output state,
        if `conditionaltwirl` is True this more efficient option is chosen -- this is option corresponds
        to "standard" DRB. (the term "conditional" refers to the fact that in this case we essentially
        implementing a particular Clifford conditional on a known input).

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
        algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuits generated
        in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
        compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
        qubits as possible.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the
        compile_clifford() function if `conditionaltwirl `is False). This includes all the optional
        arguments of these functions *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`). For most
        purposes the default options will be suitable (or at least near-optimal from the compilation methods
        in-built into pyGSTi). See the docstrings of these functions for more information.

    partitioned : bool, optional
        If False, each circuit is returned as a single full circuit. If True, each circuit is returned as
        a list of three circuits consisting of: (1) the stabilizer-prep circuit, (2) the core random circuit,
        (3) the pre-measurement circuit. In that case the full circuit is obtained by appended (2) to (1)
        and then (3) to (1).

    descriptor : str, optional
        A description of the experiment being generated. Stored in the output dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

        This function serves as an alternative to the usual method of creating a direct

        takes a list of previously-sampled random circuits and does not sampling internally.

        Parameters
        ----------
        circuits_and_idealouts_by_depth : dict
            A dictionary whose keys are integer depths and whose values are lists
            of `(circuit, ideal_outcome)` 2-tuples giving each RB circuit and its
            ideal (correct) outcome.

        qubit_labels : list, optional
            If not None, a list of the qubits to sample the circuit for. This is a subset of
            `pspec.qubit_labels`. If None, the circuit is sampled to act on all the qubits
            in `pspec`.

        sampler : str or function, optional
            If a string, this should be one of: {'edgegrab', pairingQs', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
            Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function

        samplerargs : list, optional
            A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
            Defaults to [0.25, ].
            The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec`, the second argument is `qubit_labels`,
            and `samplerargs` lists the remaining arguments handed to the sampler. This is not
            optional for some choices of `sampler`.

        addlocal : bool, optional
            Whether to follow each layer in the "core" circuits, sampled according to `sampler` with
            a layer of 1-qubit gates.

        lsargs : list, optional
            Only used if addlocal is True. A list of optional arguments handed to the 1Q gate
            layer sampler circuit_layer_by_oneQgate(). Specifies how to sample 1Q-gate layers.

        randomizeout : bool, optional
            If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is the all-zeros
            bit string. If True, the ideal output of each circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string.
            This setting is useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

        cliffordtwirl : bool, optional
            Wether to begin the circuits with a sequence that generates a random stabilizer state. For
            standard DRB this should be set to True. There are a variety of reasons why it is better
            to have this set to True.

            Some of the stabilizer state / Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default
            algorithms) are  randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuits generated
            in the iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
            generate a DRB circuit is linear in `citerations`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit gate count
            compilations of steps (1) and (3) are important in order to successfully implement DRB on as many
            qubits as possible.

        compilerargs : list, optional
            A list of arguments that are handed to the compile_stabilier_state/measurement()functions (or the

        * If `localclifford` and `paulirandomize` are False, the depth of a sampled circuit = the MRB length.
          The first length/2 layers are all sampled independently according to the sampler specified by
          `sampler`. The remaining half of the circuit is the "inversion" circuit that is determined
          by the first half.
        * If `paulirandomize` is True and `localclifford` is False, the depth of a circuit is
          `2*length+1` with odd-indexed layers sampled according to the sampler specified by `sampler`, and
          the the zeroth layer + the even-indexed layers consisting of random 1-qubit Pauli gates.
        * If `paulirandomize` and `localclifford` are True, the depth of a circuit is
          `2*length+1 + X` where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
          the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.
        * If `paulirandomize` is False and `localclifford` is True, the depth of a circuit is
          length + X where X is a random variable (between 0 and normally <= ~12-16) that accounts for
          the depth from the layer of random 1-qubit Cliffords at the start and end of the circuit.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different MRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the "wires" in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'edgegrab', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named `circuit_layer_by*` (with `*` replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not
        a valid option for n-qubit MRB -- it results in sim. 1-qubit MRB -- but it is not explicitly
        forbidden by this function]. If `sampler` is a function, it should be a function that takes
        as the first argument a QubitProcessorSpec, and returns a random circuit layer as a list of gate
        Label objects. Note that the default 'Qelimination' is not necessarily the most useful
        in-built sampler, but it is the only sampler that requires no parameters beyond the QubitProcessorSpec
        *and* works for arbitrary connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers
        for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.

    localclifford : bool, optional
        Whether to start the circuit with uniformly random 1-qubit Cliffords and all of the
        qubits (compiled into the native gates of the device).

    paulirandomize : bool, optional
        Whether to have uniformly random Pauli operators on all of the qubits before and
        after all of the layers in the "out" and "back" random circuits. At length 0 there
        is a single layer of random Pauli operators (in between two layers of 1-qubit Clifford
        gates if `localclifford` is True); at length l there are 2l+1 Pauli layers as there
        are

    descriptor : str, optional
        A string describing the generated experiment. Stored in the returned dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    """
    Experiment design for binary randomized benchmarking.

    Encapsulates a "binary randomized benchmarking" (BiRB) experiment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the experiment is being generated for. The `pspec` is always
       handed to the sampler, as the first argument of the sampler function.

    clifford_compilation: CompilationRules
        Rules for exactly (absolutely) compiling the "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

    depths : list of ints
        The "benchmark depth" of the circuit, which is the number of randomly sampled layers of gates in 
        the core circuit. The full BiRB circuit has depth=length+2. 

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different MRB circuits sampled at each length.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuit is to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.

        ordering of this list is the order of the ``wires'' in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant.

    layer_sampling: str, optional
        Determines the structure of the randomly sampled layers of gates:
            1. 'mixed1q2q': Layers contain radomly-sampled two-qubit gates and randomly-sampled 
            single-qubit gates on all remaining qubits. 
            2. 'alternating1q2q': Each layer consists of radomly-sampled two-qubit gates, with 
            all other qubits idling, followed by randomly sampled single-qubit gates on all qubits. 

    sampler : str or function, optional
        If a string, this should be one of: {'edgegrab', 'Qelimination', 'co2Qgates', 'local'}.
        Except for 'local', this corresponds to sampling layers according to the sampling function
        in rb.sampler named circuit_layer_by* (with * replaced by 'sampler'). For 'local', this
        corresponds to sampling according to rb.sampler.circuit_layer_of_oneQgates [which is not

        *and* works for arbitrary connectivity devices. See the docstrings for each of these samplers
        for more information.

    samplerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to the sampler function, specified by `sampler`.
        The first argument handed to the sampler is `pspec` and `samplerargs` lists the
        remaining arguments handed to the sampler.


    descriptor : str, optional
        A string describing the generated experiment. Stored in the returned dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    `pspec` (see the :class:`QubitProcessorSpec` object docstring for how to construct the relevant `pspec` 
    for a device).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pspec : QubitProcessorSpec
       The QubitProcessorSpec for the device that the CRB experiment is being generated for, which defines the 
       "native" gate-set and the connectivity of the device. The returned CRB circuits will be over the gates in 
       `pspec`, and will respect the connectivity encoded by `pspec`.

    clifford_compilations : dict
        A dictionary with the potential keys `'absolute'` and `'paulieq'` and corresponding class:`CompilationRules` values. 
        These compilation rules specify how to compile the "native" gates of `pspec` into Clifford gates.

    depths : list of ints
        The "CRB depths" of the circuit; a list of integers >= 0. The CRB length is the number of Cliffords in the 
        circuit - 2 *before* each Clifford is compiled into the native gate-set.

    circuits_per_depth : int
        The number of (possibly) different CRB circuits sampled at each length.

    interleaved_circuit : Circuit
        Circuit to use in the constuction of the interleaved CRB experiment. This is the circuit
        whose error rate is to be estimated by the IRB experiment.

    qubit_labels : list, optional
        If not None, a list of the qubits that the RB circuits are to be sampled for. This should
        be all or a subset of the qubits in the device specified by the QubitProcessorSpec `pspec`.
        If None, it is assumed that the RB circuit should be over all the qubits. Note that the
        ordering of this list is the order of the "wires" in the returned circuit, but is otherwise
        irrelevant. If desired, a circuit that explicitly idles on the other qubits can be obtained
        by using methods of the Circuit object.

    randomizeout : bool, optional
        If False, the ideal output of the circuits (the "success" or "survival" outcome) is always
        the all-zeros bit string. This is probably considered to be the "standard" in CRB. If True,
        the ideal output a circuit is randomized to a uniformly random bit-string. This setting is
        useful for, e.g., detecting leakage/loss/measurement-bias etc.

    citerations : int, optional
        Some of the Clifford compilation algorithms in pyGSTi (including the default algorithm) are
        randomized, and the lowest-cost circuit is chosen from all the circuit generated in the
        iterations of the algorithm. This is the number of iterations used. The time required to
        generate a CRB circuit is linear in `citerations * (CRB length + 2)`. Lower-depth / lower 2-qubit
        gate count compilations of the Cliffords are important in order to successfully implement
        CRB on more qubits.

    compilerargs : list, optional
        A list of arguments that are handed to compile_clifford() function, which includes all the
        optional arguments of compile_clifford() *after* the `iterations` option (set by `citerations`).
        In order, this list should be values for:
        
        * algorithm : str. A string that specifies the compilation algorithm. The default in
          compile_clifford() will always be whatever we consider to be the 'best' all-round
          algorithm.
        * aargs : list. A list of optional arguments for the particular compilation algorithm.
        * costfunction : 'str' or function. The cost-function from which the "best" compilation
          for a Clifford is chosen from all `citerations` compilations. The default costs a
          circuit as 10x the num. of 2-qubit gates in the circuit + 1x the depth of the circuit.
        * prefixpaulis : bool. Whether to prefix or append the Paulis on each Clifford.
        * paulirandomize : bool. Whether to follow each layer in the Clifford circuit with a
          random Pauli on each qubit (compiled into native gates). I.e., if this is True the
          native gates are Pauli-randomized. When True, this prevents any coherent errors adding
          (on average) inside the layers of each compiled Clifford, at the cost of increased
          circuit depth. Defaults to False.
        
        For more information on these options, see the compile_clifford() docstring.

    descriptor : str, optional
        A string describing the experiment generated, which will be stored in the returned
        dictionary.

    add_default_protocol : bool, optional
        Whether to add a default RB protocol to the experiment design, which can be run
        later (once data is taken) by using a :class:`DefaultProtocolRunner` object.

    seed : int, optional
        A seed to initialize the random number generator used for creating random clifford
        circuits. The first of the two subdesigns will use the specified seed directly,
        while the second will use seed+1.

    verbosity : int, optional
        If > 0 the number of circuits generated so far is shown.

    interleave : bool, optional
        Whether the circuits of the standard CRB and IRB sub designs should be interleaved to
        form the circuit ordering of this experiment design. E.g. when calling the `all_circuits_needing_data`
        attribute.

        defaultfit: 'A-fixed' or 'full'

            If 'A-fixed' then the default results displayed are those from fitting with A
            fixed, and if 'full' then the default results displayed are those where A is a

            The summary data is fit to A + Bp^m with A fixed and with A has a fit parameter,

            The RB error rate definition convention. 'EI' results in RB error rates that are associated

            multiple keys and none of them are 'full', `fitkey` must be specified when
            `decay` is True.

        decay : bool, optional
            Whether to plot a fit, or just the data.

        success_probabilities : bool, optional
            Whether to plot the success probabilities distribution, as a violin plot. (as well
            as the *average* success probabilities at each length).

            The figure size

        Parameters
        ----------
        defaultfit: 'A-fixed' or 'full'
            The summary data is fit to A + Bp^m with A fixed and with A as a fit parameter.
            If 'A-fixed' then the default results displayed are those from fitting with A
            fixed, and if 'full' then the default results displayed are those where A is a
            fit parameter.

        asymptote : 'std' or float, optional
            The summary data is fit to A + Bp^m with A fixed and with A has a fit parameter,
            with the default results returned set by `defaultfit`. This argument specifies the
            value used when 'A' is fixed. If left as 'std', then 'A' defaults to 1/2^n if

            `adjusted_success_probabilities`.

        rtype : 'EI' or 'AGI', optional
            The RB error rate definition convention. 'EI' results in RB error rates that are associated
            with the entanglement infidelity, which is the error probability with stochastic Pauli errors.
            'AGI' results in RB error rates that are associated with the average gate infidelity.

        seed : list, optional
            Seeds for the fit of B and p (A is seeded to the asymptote defined by `asympote`).

        bootstrap_samples : float, optional
            The number of samples for generating bootstrapped error bars.

        depths: list or 'all'
            If not 'all', a list of depths to use (data at other depths is discarded).

        name : str, optional
            The name of this protocol, also used to (by default) name the
