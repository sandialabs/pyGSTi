    Create an operator for `lbl` from the factories in `factory_dict`.

    If the label has arguments, then this function looks for an

    :meth:`OpFactory.create_simplified_op`.  with the label's

    Raises a `KeyError` if a matching factory cannot be found.

class OpFactory(_gm.ModelMember):
    """
    An object that can generate "on-demand" operators (can be SPAM vecs, etc., as well) for a Model.

    It is assigned certain parameter indices (it's a ModelMember), which definie
    the block of indices it may assign to its created operations.

    The central method of an OpFactory object is the `create_op` method, which
    creates an operation that is associated with a given label.  This is very
    similar to a LayerLizard's function, though a LayerLizard has detailed
    knowledge and access to a Model's internals whereas an OpFactory is meant to
    create a self-contained class of operators (e.g. continuously parameterized
    gates or on-demand embedding).

    This class just provides a skeleton for an operation factory - derived
    classes add the actual code for creating custom objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_space : StateSpace
        The state-space of the operation(s) this factory builds.

    evotype : Evotype
        The evolution type of the operation(s) this factory builds.

        Create the object that implements the operation associated with the given `args` and `sslbls`.

        **Note to developers**
        The difference beween this method and :meth:`create_op` is that
        this method just creates the foundational object without needing
        to setup its parameter indices (a technical detail which connects
        the created object with the originating factory's parameters).  The
        base-class `create_op` method calls `create_object` and then performs
        some additional setup on the returned object before returning it
        itself.  Thus, unless you have a reason for implementing `create_op`
        it's often more convenient and robust to implement this function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        args : list or tuple
