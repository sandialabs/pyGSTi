 * H is a complex Hilbert space equipped with the standard basis.

   standard basis vectors of H.

 * Given a complex Hilbert space, U, we write M[U] to denote the space of linear

        presence of a designated basis for L.
        
        If elements of L are naturally expressed as matrices, then a basis for L
        lets us identify elements of L with vectors of length dim(L).

    See below for this function's original use-case.
    
    Raison d'etre
    -------------
    Suppose we canonically measure the distance between two process matrices (M1, M2) by

        D(M1, M2; H) = max || (M1 - M2) v ||
                            v is in H,                   (Eq. 1)
                            tr(v) = 1,
                            v is positive

    for some norm || * ||.  Suppose also that we want an analog of this distance when
    (M1, M2) are restricted to the linear subspace U consisting of all vectors in H
    whose matrix representations are zero outside of their leading d-by-d submatrix.

    One natural way to do this is via the function D(M1, M2; U) -- i.e., just replace
    H in (Eq. 1) with the subspace U. Using P to denote the orthogonal projector onto U,
    we claim that we can evaluate this function via the identity

        D(M1, M2; U) = D(M1 P, M2 P; H).                (Eq. 2)

    To see why this is the case, consider a positive vector v and its projection u = P v.
    Since a vector is called positive whenever its Hermitian matrix representation is positive
    semidefinite (PSD), we need to show that u is positive. This can be seen by considering
    block 2-by-2 partitions of the matrix representations of (u,v), where the leading block
    is d-by-d:

        mat(v) = [x11,  x12]         and      mat(u) = [x11,  0]
                 [x21,  x22]                           [  0,  0].
    
    In particular, u is positive if and only if x11 is PSD, and x11 must be PSD for v
    to be positive. Furthermore, positivity of v requires that x22 is PSD, which implies

        0 <= tr(u) = tr(x11) <= tr(v).
    
    Given this, it is easy to establish (Eq 2.) by considering how the following pair 
    of problems have the same optimal objective function value

        max || (M1 - M2) P v ||         and        max || (M1 - M2) P v || 
            mat(v) = [x11, x12]                         mat(v) = [x11, x12]
                     [x21, x22]                                  [x21, x22]
            mat(v) is PSD                               x11 is PSD
            tr(x11) + tr(x22) = 1                       tr(x11) <= 1.

    In fact, this can be taken a little further! The whole argument goes through unchanged
    if, instead of starting with the objective function || (M1 - M2) v ||, we started with
    f((M1 - M2) v) and f satisfied the property that f(c v) >= f(v) whenever c is a scalar
    greater than or equal to one.
