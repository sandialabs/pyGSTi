""" Legacy modelpacks for common models

In earlier versions of pyGSTi (prior to v0.9.9), modelpack access
worked differently. The modelpacks in this packages do not use
multi-qubit labelling conventions. These modelpacks are included for
backwards-compatibility but should generally be treated as if they
were deprecated.
